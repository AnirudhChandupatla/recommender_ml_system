It does have a few flaws, though.<br /><br />First, it gives you indication as to how much ice is left. It will tell you when it's full, and indicate when it snot full.  But it can be 95% full or 2% full, and the only way you will know when it's empty is when it stops dispensing ice. You can't look inside because there is no way to open it and look.<br /><br />The ice is on the soft, wet side. It's not as cold as it could be; it's close to melting. This makes it soft for chewing, but it melts easily and waters down drinks quickly.<br /><br />The machine is pretty noisy while it's making ice.<br /><br />The ice has a plastic-like chemical taste to it even after running a couple of gallons of water through it.

The finish is chrome, but the handles and other accents are brushed steel, so it doesn't really match well. And the other, (which many other reviews elsewhere state) is how loud the clock is. It doesn't bother me and actually I've grown used to it, but there is a slight, low &#34;grinding&#34; noise that comes from it which sounds a little like tiny gears are grinding away which might get on the nerves of some people.

Something fell on the heating element and rather than the fuse working it burned all the way through..leaving a 1 inch gap in the heating element.  Replaced that and found that the thermal link has probably burned through because of that incident...I say that because now the heat doesn't work - in spite of the new heating element. I understand why the link burned up..not how it burned up AND the heating element managed to destroy itself. You would have thought the link would have protected the element. Unfortunately not. Have heard people complain the unit is noisy...obviously they are used to some higher-end machines that I've never owned since this has been the quietest machine ever. It didn't cost much, parts are not expensive, but after owning a machine that never clogged (this one needs cleaned out annually or it will clog..and yes we scrape our dishes) - I am not overwhelmed with this one. I've owned more expensive machines and never had these issues.

It's not wimpy, so your kitchen won't smell like bacon for hours and the grease/steam will be sucked up before it ends up on your kitchen cabinet.  The filters are easy to take out for cleaning, but it is rather noisy.  Houzz has a good article on how to select an extractor hood, which I'd suggest reading before you order one.<br />Here's my sadder, but wiser review:<br />The fan went out in late 2019 and was recently repaired (after numerous calls to Zephyr Tech Support).  Here are the problems, according to our repair people:<br />1.  Microfuse is of an inadequate capacity to handle the hood.<br />2.  Motherboard failed.  Unclear what happened, but best guess is that this was because of a power surge.  However, you can't install surge protection for this hood.<br />3.  Switch was also replaced.  The switch has to PRECISELY line up with the windows on the outside of the hood or nothing works (this came from Tech Support; it's not in the manual).  Unfortunately, there is a plate riveted behind the switch, which makes it extremely difficult to line up the switch (the plate should have been screwed in) because it's a space that's too small for fingers.  This task took two experienced guys a couple of hours of contorting themselves, adding shims, taking the Lord's name in vain, etc.<br />4.  Wires are too close to the motherboard, which we were informed might lead to more trouble in the future.<br />5.  The duct cover had to be basically dismantled to do the repair work; there should have been an access panel.<br />6.  This hood had been installed and then the drywaller/plasterer had done his work where the duct cover met the ceiling.  This was unavoidably damaged repairing the hood.  There should be a metal trim piece that could go around the duct cover at the ceiling, but Zephyr doesn't make one and this duct cover is a weird size, so you can't just buy one from another manufacturer (most of whom seem to make this part).

One month out of warranty, it failed due to the water pump failing and it burned up (no fire, but you know what I mean). Repair was going to be $500.00. Such a high end machine should not fail!

She puts me on hold to see if she can find someone to help.

AHRXTZUUZT4SILDGYOLHPHZ36KQA,B0029DA0MO,1.0,1248314628000,False,18,"In April of 2009 we purchased several Architect Series stainless steel KitchenAid appliances from a local authorized dealer including a diswasher, microwave, stove, warming drawer and a 36"" cooktop and downdraft unit (~$10,000 of product).  When the cooktop unit arrived it was installed by the local dealer's service technicians.  During the installation we discovered that a number of pieces were missing from the cooktop including burner tops that prevented us from using the cooktop.  After 3 to 4 phone calls to Whirlpool and about 2 weeks later we finally received the parts and discovered that Whirlpool (owner of KitchenAid brand) had sent the wrong parts.  After several more phone calls we were finally sent what we thought were the remaining correct parts.  After the technician arrived to install them he found that we were missing more burner parts from the high capacity burner and that using the burner without these parts had scorched the cooktop slightly.  At the same time we discovered that the downdraft system activation button was not working correctly and more new parts for both items were ordered by the technician.  A new cooktop was ordered and then installed about 3-4 weeks later by the local dealer.  After the cooktop was installed we discovered that it was scratched badly and ordered another.  About 2 weeks later the parts for the downdraft arrived and were installed by the technicians.  The next day the downdraft system got stuck in the up and on position and could not be turned off.  Another cooktop arrived several weeks later and was installed.  I called the local dealer frustrated at having paid for a new cooktop in April and still not able to use it fully in late July and was told by the owner that we had to wait to have a Whirlpool authorized 3rd party technician come to our house to evaluate the unit before Whirlpool would do anything to replace or repair the downdraft unit.  Meanwhile, after 4-5 phonecalls and being transferred around in Whirlpool's ""customer service"" bureacracy of divisions we tried to get a replacement unit and were told by Whirlpool that they would send us one but that they were on backorder and it would be mid-August before one could be delivered to our home.  We asked them if they could find one at a distributor or retailer and have that unit sent to us and were told by the ""customer service"" person that they don't do that.  They furthermore said that we could try to do that on our own but that they would only refund exactly the discounted price that we paid from the local retailer and not what we would have to pay to get one delivered from somewhere else in the country to our home.<br /><br />I run a manufacturing business that sells products in the same price range as these appliances through distribution to retail stores.  We occassionally make mistakes as do all companies.  When a customer has a problem, our customer service ensures that the customer is taken care of immediately either through a local retailer or directly from us.  We see a problem as an opportunity to have customers rave about our service levels to other potential customers and realize that service attitude and responsiveness pays for itself several times over in the positive word of mouth versus the negative that would occur if we didn't do this.  Whirlpool had a huge opportunity to have my wife and I telling a wonderful customer service story that would have positively influenced other potential customers in an affluent community where many of our friends and neighbors are upgrading kitchens.  Instead I will be telling as many people as I can both verbally and online about my experience and the impact to their sales will be 10-100 times what it would have cost them to be nice to us and try to solve our problem.  I hope that someone in the management of Whirlpool someday gets this message and uses it to change the company for the positive. Meanwhile, I suggest that if you can, you should avoid buying any of the brands that are made and serviced by Whirlpool.",Quality and Customer Service Nightmare,[],B0029DA0MO

We were in the middle of construction and it was several months before we even opened the box. After opening it, we hung it the hood only to realize that a lot of the sheet metal underneath was completely bent and the fan motor was hanging by 2 bolts and vibrating substantially. Amazon took it back but didn't have another one at the same price (??) so I ordered another one from another place. The second came with a dead short somewhere inside the unit and nearly cost us our electrical inspection. The third one finally came with no damage or defects and was hung. Both of the first two units also had screws rolling around in the box.<br /><br />On the bright side, the unit looks nice and can definitely move some air. On the lower speeds, it is indeed quiet. The lights are decent but having lights in the back too would have been nice. As someone who is tall, if I had it to do again, I would order one with front controls rather than under to avoid having to bend down to see the buttons.<br /><br />I am definitely concerned about the longevity of this unit based on the first 2 units. If it does break down, I don't have a lot of confidence that I will be able to find parts for it. If I wasn't jammed up on the schedule, I would have looked to another brand.<br /><br />I really want to root for these guys but this isn't a cheap hood and 2 out of 3 units being defective is pretty bad.",the unit looks nice and can definitely move some air but quality is lacking,[],B00EQGNQO6

BUT<br /><br />The ice dispenser continuously dropped cubes on the floor and we had a number of slipping incidents. I ended up putting a small rug by the fridge to catch the ice and prevent slips to fix that. Minor problem. But ...<br /><br /> Within a week or two of installing the fridge, the ice dispenser jammed up. I took a look and discovered a block of ice had formed, from the dispenser chute into the removable ice bucket inside the door. I could not remove the bucket to get at the blockage because it was ""glued"" to the door with ice.<br /><br />I ended up having to defrost the freezer to get the ice out. Within two weeks of doing this the same thing happened. For several months I developed a weekly routine of using a blow dryer to get the ice bucket out, dumping out all the ice in the bucket to melt out the block of ice at the bottom of the bucket, clearing the jam out of the chute, drying everything off and reinstalling. Takes about an hour each time.<br /><br />I had assumed there was some sort of installation mistake. Turns out not. It is a known design flaw.<br /><br />I finally called a Maytag repairman after a shelf broke in the refrigerator ( which appear to be cheaply made) and decided to have both taken care of while under warranty. The repairman explained this is a known design flaw and that what I had been doing weekly is considered the ""routine maintenance"" to take care of the problem. It's due to moisture and water building up in the chute each time you dispense ice. They recommend doing it every two weeks, although in our case we must be ""heavy"" ice users because we need to do it weekly. He said done properly you can do it in 20 minutes or so rather than the hour I've been taking.<br /><br />However, he spend well over 20 minutes trying to remove the ice bucket and gave up. So I think his 20 minute estimate is optimistic.<br /><br />He pointed out that they note this procedure in the owners manual. I pointed out you don't see this until after your purchase the fridge and I certainly wouldn't have purchased a fridge requiring this level of ""routine maintenance.""<br /><br />Additionally, a plastic part had broken off in the dispenser apparently unrelated to this problem, according to the repairman, that requires replacement of the door. This is under warranty currently but is going to be an expensive problem if it recurs out of warranty.<br /><br />I called Maytag directly and they confirmed that it is a known design flaw and the solution is the ""routine maintenance"" I am already doing. They said they are no fixes nor are they correcting the problem by offering a replacement ice maker.<br /><br />So if you consider spending an hour a week on an ice maker ""routine maintenance"", Maytag is your company.","Avoid ""Store N Door"" !!!!",[],B0093C0IWG

I preferred my old vented Axxis to this one but Bosch stopped making vented ones.<br />If you have pets regular maintenance is needed. You have the regular lint trap to clean and since the mesh is so fine and you use dryer sheets you have to scrub it periodically to get rid of the wax build up or it will, clog, overheat, and shut down—requiring a maintenance call to pay someone a lot of money to take off a back panel and push a button. Then you have to periodically clean the condenser which builds up hair and lint. If you don’t, the dryer becomes inefficient and eventually stops drying. Washing the condenser in your sink or tub will wash a bunch of hair down the drain leading to potential clogs. Finally you have to clean the sump—where the moisture from you condenser goes. If not, the pump clogs and the water pools and your clothes don’t dry. This is the trickiest one to clean as it is in the way back and the sump cover is a pain in the butt to open. If you are not handy and own this dryer, you will be regularly paying someone a lot of money to do basic maintenance.<br />Note: the default dry setting are a bit damp for someone like me who has dust allergies.

Buying the complete kit actually was the best idea because as it turns out it, wasn't the pronged piece we thought, it was the red cable wire that had burned out on one end! Thankfully this kit has everything you need, it has been 2 weeks and is still working great, the only downside to this kit is, that the little red cable in the kit was a bit short, so we had to splice it and crimp with the old wire and seal it in electrical tape!

If you don't match the correct pureWash model to your machine, you're gonna have a bad time.  So please do go beyond knowing if your machine is HE or not.  Some HE machines fill faster than others and therefore will need a ""high flow"" model.<br /><br />I have two pureWash units.  One for my home and one for a home I rent out.  The tenants of my rental property are thrilled at how their laundry becomes clean in only cold water with no use of detergent, thus saving them money.  I'm thrilled because the rent they pay me isn't being spent on excessive hot water sucking up my profits.<br /><br />You must pre-treat certain stains.  Food coloring and ink stains need to be pre-treated.  I have not found a food stain which needs pre-treating.  I have not found any stains from hunting (blood, mud, etc.) which need pre-treating.  The pureWash system is a boon for hunters who want to remove scents from hunting garb.<br /><br />I also attached a ""Y"" splitter with valves so I can have ""pureWash water on demand"".  I use this to clean surfaces and....though I am not advising one do this....I swish it in my mouth as a rinse.  It tastes and reacts a lot like diluted hydrogen peroxide and studies have shown it to have many benefits.  NEVER SWALLOW IT.<br /><br />I am hoping the pureWash system may someday be integrated into a ""cold water only"" machine.  With a pureWash system, all the extra 'bells & whistles' are no longer necessary.  No more need for ""Steam Washing"" or ""Sanitizing Cycles"".  I just want a very basic machine with about five wash options (Delicate, Normal, Bulky, Heavy Duty and Rinse/Spin), three spin speeds and large capacity.  No more heaters, no more ""Intelligent Laundry Aid Dispersal Units"" and all that garbage we didn't have back in the 70s.

However the plastic flange that sits on the surface of the filter socket; was smaller/ narrower than the stock filter. As a result you can see a space around all 4 sides of the filter after it is installed (see photo with pink arrows).

After paying the contractor/plumber fees (2 Times) amounting to $800 - the contractor installed the replacement stove top and did a gas check to see if everything was working well after the installation.  When the burners were turned on the plumber/contractor smelled gas again.  They tested all of the gas lines and lines were fine...It was again, a gas leak in the stove and it had to be removed once again.  This is a very seriously dangerous product.

I contacted the Perfect Pod Support staff, and I have been very pleased with their persistence in resolving this issue.  After providing proof of purchase to verify I had purchased the Eco-Fill 2.0, they sent me a replacement right away.  The replacement was a slightly different color, and it didn't work either.  After reporting that back to Perfect Pod support, they sent me a second replacement which works great.  During this process, I started having trouble with my Keurig machine in that the screen would go blank and I would have to unplug the machine to reset it.  Keurig sent me a replacement machine.  When I received that machine, I tried the earlier versions of the Eco-Fill 2.0 and they worked fine.  So my take on this is that some of the Keurig machines are more sensitive than others which explains why many users had no problems with the Eco-Fill 2.0 and a few did have problems.  The bottom line is that Perfect Pod appears to now have an Eco-Fill 2.0 unit that works even with the sensitive machines.

I asked what to do with the old unit and they said whatever you want.  That is when i got suspicious.

I was disappointed to see that it arrived with a dent on the left backside edge of the machine.  The machine washes well. The clothes do come out clean as long as you don't load it over 11 lbs.  I wish the machine would move a little stronger and faster during the wash cycle. The machine will wash and stop during the wash cycle.  It is not a continuous washing movement.  I don't know if that makes any difference in how well it washes.  I guess I'm used to a larger machine with a stronger washing cycle. Also, I thought the machine looks a little larger than I expected. If you are looking to put it in a closet it would have to be a walk-in closet or a very long and wide closet. The machine does have two wheels on the backside, but if you are planning to move it a lot, I suggest a dolly. The machine is a little heavy, so it is easier to move with the dolly.  Again it washes well and does what I need it for. I was not happy with the dent, but because it is on the backside and not that noticeable, I took my husband's advice. We felt it wasn't worth going through the trouble of sending it back when the machine, up to now, is working well. Anyway, who's to say that we might not end up getting another machine that may have more dents and not work as well. Based on some reviews I read on receiving portable machines with dent through online shopping,  I knew it was a possibility that the machine might come with a dent. And it did. But not too bad.  I did send for a very nice cover for the machine and you can't even notice the dent.","Not perfect, but good enough","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/315eiFeiyBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/315eiFeiyBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/315eiFeiyBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TNCftVYVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TNCftVYVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61TNCftVYVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B089YSKJY6

Like many other people writing reviews here, I was frustrated with the cost, lack of options and waste of traditional K-Cups.  Having heard less than stellar things about many different types of reusable K-Cup filters I was ecstatic to hear about the EkoBrew.  I immediately ordered a 2-pack in anticipation of using them daily - boy was I in for a surprise.<br /><br />After unpacking the EkoBrews I immediately filled them up with DunkinDonuts Bold coffee grounds about 2/3 full, just as the instructions indicate.  I properly closed the lid, ensuring a tight seal and no coffee near the o-ring which would potentially allow leakage.  Popped it in the Keurig and pressed brew.  To my dismay, water began leaking out all over the spout of the Keurig, luckily mostly landing in my wide mug.  While watching the coffee dispense I noticed at first the color was dark, and appeared to look like coffee, however by the end it was nearly clear water.<br /><br />Willing to accept some degree of mess (still probably easier than conventional brewing) I took a sip of the coffee and immediately poured it out. Watery and with a large quantity of coffee grounds was not what I had in mind. I then opened up the Kuerig only to find coffee basically everywhere, so I quickly attempted to wipe it down with a rag, but obviously was unable to get into every nook and cranny.  On top of that, when I closed the hatch more coffee leaked out of the spout, getting my counter and bottom of the Keurig dirty - the phrase insult to injury comes to mind.<br /><br />Needless to say I am disgusted with this product.  Taking a risk on a 3rd party device to outperform an expensive, wasteful alternative is one thing, but the harm done to the (very) expensive device is an atrocity.  I couldn't care less about not being able to return a worthless device, but I want my Keurig to be clean again. My only hope is that this is a function of this particular device, however, if you are using the B70 Platinum I encourage you to seek other products or stick to K-Cups.",Ridiculously Disappointed,[],B0051SU0OW

Front Control Slide-In Electric Range with Convection & Wi-Fi in Stainless Steel is a great oven, but like with everything in life, it could be better.<br />Let me start by listing the Pros:<br />Fingerprint Resistant: It does minimize the number of fingerprints on the stainless-steel frame, but it may leave little smudges here or there.<br />Five heating elements: The power on the heating elements is awesome.  It provides fast heat in just seconds.  It also includes two dual ring elements to be used with multiple sized pots and pans.<br />Oven: large 6.3 cu. ft. oven is big enough to accommodate multiple large dishes at once, especially with the holidays coming up.  Powerful convention decreases the time for baking, roasting and evenly cooking food.  Compatible with SmartThings and any virtual assistance available.<br /><br />Now the Cons:<br />Fingerprint resistant: smudges are still visible and will build up if not wiped.  Touch screen smudges constantly and it is very sensitive to the touch.  Any passing of a cloth on the touch screen will activate any of the features.  The locking mechanism is available, but it also locks the oven door and if the sensors do not detect the door, it will take a while for the locking mechanism to work.  Additionally, there are no instructions on the usage of the touch screen controls in either of the three manuals that come in the box.  To get a detailed description on the touch screen features, you will need to go to Samsung’s website and download the manual for the range.<br />Cooktop: even after the hot surface indicator turns off, the cooktop still stays very warm and will burn your hand to the touch.  It does take quite a while for the cooktop to be cold.  Cleaning the cooktop has been an issue.  Even with the warm surface cooktop, the cloth will stick to the cooktop and will leave a permanent mark on it.<br />Virtual Assistance:  As cool as it is to have an oven that is controlled via Bixby, Google Assistance, Alexa, SmartThings, etc., it really is only good for utilizing the oven feature.  The SmartThings App will let you control the oven light and the oven temperature, but you do not have any access to the cooktop.  It will let you know that the cooktop is on, but you can not turn it off.  If you do utilize any of the virtual assistance voice commands to pre-heat your oven, make sure that there is nothing inside the oven i.e. pots, pans, etc. I believe this feature is only good if you are out of the house and realize you want to cook a frozen pizza and need the oven to be pre-heated.  Not sure how many times this feature will be utilized, but it is available.<br />**Testing the product as part of an Insiders promotion**",Slide in Perfection,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716j+GCwMeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716j+GCwMeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/716j+GCwMeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R4ItAJ+RL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R4ItAJ+RL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71R4ItAJ+RL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ccN2PvXgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ccN2PvXgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71ccN2PvXgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08CBNNB5H

Its a legitimately full-blown addiction and my brain is completely dead until I've hit the right caffeine intake. If you have the option-switch to green tea or something because having caffeine headaches and being mean without your fix isn't a cute look. However-if you're already hooked and need it, I don't have to tell you how expensive it is. Especially with cold brew-a Toddy cold brew from the cafe I used to work at was $6. A Starbucks Nitro cold brew is about the same. For awhile, I was using Chameleon (given up recently due to them being Nestle-owned) or buying the $6 jugs of pre-made cold brew from the grocery store (which would only last me a day and a half, at best). This filter has changed my game. I fill this filter with ground coffee and drop it in a 4-pint mason jar, then leave it in the fridge for ~19 hrs. I alternate it between a couple jars to keep a steady supply. Remove the filter, pour over some ice, add a pump of macadamia nut syrup and a splash of coconut milk and enjoy the savings. This has made a serious dent in my coffee budget and ensures that I never run out of fresh cold brew and become a monster of a human. Highly recommend.",Goodbye Expensive Cold Brew!,[],B072FP89P1

Due to where my washer and dryer are located, I had to disconnect both of them and physically move them out.  I disconnected the dryer vent which actually needed to be replaced.  Then I shut off the gas and disconnected the line.  I removed the power and disconnected the water lines and drain hose from the washer which spilled a decent amount of water on the floor.  Years of being in place yielded a lot of dirt and grime.  So, I cleaned under and the back of both appliances and the dryer vent.  Then a quick trip to the hardware store for a replacement vent hose.  I was finally ready to place this product on my washing machine which turned out to be a little more involved as I was doing this by myself.  It’s not that easy to lift up the appliance and try to place the pad on the foot of the washer by yourself.  The pads gripped my floor pretty well too which made it difficult to move the washer back into place.<br /><br />What seems on the surface like a 15 minute job, just pick up the machine and throw the four pads on, turned into an almost 5 hour ordeal.  Again, not a reflection on the product but I do consider this as part of the installation.  So, the moral of this story!  This would have been much easier with two people.  If I had another person I would have placed the pads after moving the washing machine back in place instead of before and struggling to get it in place.  Plan on having to clean under, behind and around the appliances.  On a good note, I did get two and a half pairs of mismatched socks.  And, this is very important, if you have a gas appliance as I did and you need to move and/or disconnect it.  Please know what you are doing, this is not for amateurs and can result in catastrophic damage and potentially loss of life.  Call a professional.  Also make sure that not only there are no leaks (gas and water) but that your dryer vent/hose are not bound or kinked and able to vent properly.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me I only got one set which I put on my washer.  I wish I would have picked up an extra set for the dryer at the same time.  I’ve only done two loads but have had zero issues.  My washing machine actually seems a little quieter while operating.

Result: it catches more lint.<br /><br />Overall though, let's cry shame on the manufacturers of electric dryers, none of which seem to be able to make a filter that truly catches even 50% of the lint.  A special problem if your dryer for some reason has to be vented indoors (mine does); but still bad even if you're just pushing all that lint outdoors to flutter around and goop up the air.",An Improvement on OEM,[],B0123NHMXE

It sits upright under my Dell monitor without needing the built in stand and can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius.",Practical thermometer and hygrometer,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CIoAOuvLL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CIoAOuvLL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61CIoAOuvLL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EABHqYnRL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EABHqYnRL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EABHqYnRL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ps+VW-hXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ps+VW-hXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ps+VW-hXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zsDvmixUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zsDvmixUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61zsDvmixUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NXlSgTuXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NXlSgTuXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71NXlSgTuXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sgo8F4enL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sgo8F4enL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sgo8F4enL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0BMFXNCV2

I told her when I stayed in Hawaii in a condo on vacation and they had a Keurig I was wanting to use the coffee I got at the coffee plantation and found reusable holders at a local store. I used them during vacation them gave them to the daughter of a friend who just had her first shared apartment after college and it included a shared Keurig. She thought the pods were too pricey and did not include her favorite roast. She thanks me every time I see her.<br />So I told my friend I would check Amazon. I learned the ones I bought were for the first Keurig model and now there were some differences. Also the company now sold a single refillable option but it was pricey and why only one when sometimes you want to make several cups for guests. These seemed to have high ratings and would work on her 2.0, so I ordered a set. I liked that the company  made a 60-day satisfaction guarantee, too. She called me this afternoon to say she just made her first cup of coffee and it was perfect. There was no hassle-- unless you count that she was so busy watching it start she forgot to put a cup under it. Quickly rectified and she is very happy with your product.<br /><br />Update: (9.7.17) My friend has been using these now for several months and likes them so well she bought another pack to have ready when she has meetings at her house. I also got her the &#34;Optional Disposable Paper Filters for Reusable K Cups (200/Box)&#34; Delibru recently added to Amazon.  [[ASIN:B072M61R6C Optional Disposable Paper Filters for Reusable K Cups (200/Box)]] She called the first day she tried them and said they are perfect for her &#34;picky&#34; guests who do not like the grounds sometimes in the coffee. When we got together yesterday she said they are so much help and keep her from spilling any grounds when she inserts the cup. She couldn't believe how accurately they fit the cups either. So I can update my review saying both DELIBRU CUPS AND FILTERS ARE AWESOME.<br />I can say from my view as purchaser the company sends emails and coupons and actively supports purchaser's needs.<br /><br />Another update(8/15/18) I bought a Keurig following the trip to Hawaii and ordered my first Delibru reusable cups in January,2017 so knew I liked them before I got ones for friends. I wanted to note my cups are still in use daily and I have not had any wear out in any way. I noted someone felt certain the mesh would wear out but mine has not in over a year. I love the fresh taste and smell of freshly ground coffee when I fill them, then brew them. I can wash them out easily. My hint there is I use a Q-tip to remove any grounds from inner rim. I also have put an arrow with a permanent black marker to indicate where the cut out for opening the cup is located and a &#34;D&#34; on ones I use for decaf for when I prepare them ahead for a coffee gathering.",A perfect gift for coffee lovers with favorite roasts that supports environmental concerns at the same time,[],B01DP1IWKU

AFOFR7LIIXXBOC4WZONTO4Q5CQMA,B074R9CWVJ,5.0,1613600594957,False,2,"We have had the PHS930SLSS GE Profile induction range about 6 months, and are generally very pleased with it.  We finally took the plunge into induction cooking, and don't regret it a bit--much happier with it than with the glass top range it replaced.<br /><br />Of course, you need induction-ready pans, but one thing we didn't realize is that all induction-ready pans are not alike! We noticed that some pans-usually lighter ones--heated up a lot faster than others, so I did a little experiment and found that to boil 16 oz of water took between 1.5 and 4.5 minutes.  The fastest times were pricey, quality stainless-clad pans and the slowest were light, inexpensive pans from that Swedish household goods superstore.  They work, but just are not as efficient or responsive.  I'm assuming that it has to do with the amount of iron or steel in the bottom of the pan.<br /><br />Here are the Pros for this range:<br />--Easy to clean top.  Because it doesn't get nearly as hot as a radiant glass-top range, all that scraping and scrubbing is gone!  Ten times easier to clean than any other range we've owned.<br />--Stylish, modern design. It's a beautiful appliance.<br />--Interface of the control panel is excellent. Very intuitive and quick and easy to set.<br />--Good convection oven.  The temperature differential (called ""Auto Conversion"" in the manual) between convection (usually 25° lower than non-convection) can be adjusted or eliminated.  I turned off the Auto Conversion and the baking times are more realistic.  Baking is even, and preheating is not terribly fast but not a problem either.<br />--The Warming Zone, the middle back ""burner,"" works well.  It is thermal, not induction.<br />--Proofing feature of the oven is handy for bread making.<br />--The oven probe works well on cooking meats and is easy to set up.<br />--Visibility into the oven is good.<br />--Range has internet connectivity, but we do not see a need to turn the oven on or off and set the temperature remotely.  A solution looking for a problem. Also, GE asks for a lot of personal information to use the app.<br /><br />Cons:<br />--The beeps of the timer and oven preheat are way too soft. Even set at the loudest setting, they can be inaudible.<br />--The broiler requires that the oven door be closed.  Many cooks like to have the door open a bit to broil.<br />--The glass control panel gets messy because of splatter, and must be turned off in order to wipe it clean...otherwise, the cleaning cloth activates the various controls.  Not a big issue, but an inconvenience.<br />--The oven light stays on forever.  I much prefer a time-out on the light after an adjustable time so you don't find the light on the next morning.<br />--The ""soft close"" drawer under the oven required some adjustment when we got the range, and it only works when the drawer is within an inch of closing.  Just as easy to close it all the way yourself.<br />--Very few accessories are available. GE only offers broiler pans and more wire oven racks.  I would love to see optional deluxe oven racks that have drawer-slide mechanisms which pull all the way out without tilting and maybe spilling oven contents.  Many higher-end ranges have these, and I would like GE to offer these as an optional accessory.<br />--There is a slight hotspot in the middle of each induction burner.  This may be the case with all induction ranges, but the evenness of the cooking area could be better.  This is mitigated by a quality pan which evens out the heat across the surface of the pan.<br />--No printed manual.  Come on, GE...this kind of money for an appliance and no printed manual?<br /><br />Even with these cons, it's the best range we've ever owned.",Best range we've ever owned,[],B074R9CWVJ

But these rollers keep me from not being able to use this dishwasher while I find a dishwashers with a better design.<br /><br />Not related to the wheels, but if your plastic silverware basket is crumbling away get a stainless steel basket!

I got these along with my first AeroPress, and I was not sure if I should have bought the metal filter or if it was just as good to use the paper ones. In any case, I keep using the metal filter even though I have a pile of the little paper ones right there, so I guess I do prefer it! I use the inverted brewing method, so I do not have the issue some people have had with feeling like the coffee goes right through the filter. When I do flip the AeroPress over to press, I would say it is easier to press than with the paper filter, because it is true the metal filter gives less resistance. It still does a great job of filtering the coffee.<br /><br />One other tip--I have found that if I allow the AeroPress to cool just slightly before cleaning out the grounds, then the grounds do not stick to the metal filter. You can easily just lift the metal filter off of the grounds, and then dump the grounds into your trash or compost. I know the AeroPress guide advises cleaning it immediately before you even take a sip of coffee, but I find it easier to wait just a short amount of time, and hopefully the AeroPress will hold up to that over time. If you are a firm believer in cleaning it immediately, you may find that the grounds stick to the metal filter when they are still very moist and hot.",Works great with inverted brewing method,[],B00SAEX73U

For the person who could not bake cookies, I don't know what to say. This over gets hot and cooks very fast. Two choices are either conventional or convection. The convection is 25 degrees less but heats at 25 higher. By that I mean if you would use 350 degrees in a normal oven, you type this on this oven, and it actually uses 325 degrees. I can use metal and foil inside. The inside cobalt blue color is so pretty. There was another review about being able to use burners only high or low. That is not true. You hit high or low and it starts at the highest or lowest temperature. Then you can use the arrows to increase or decrease the temperature from there. It does not come with a cord, so I purchased one because I want a new one. I could have used the one from the old oven, but opted for the new cord. To know which one to get. Look at your current oven and unplug it, then count the prongs. You need a 3 or a 4 prong based on the socket in your wall. Hope this helps you out.

My AeroPress never came with a Tote Bag because of where I bought it from, but I haven't needed one yet. This has been the best investment I've made regarding coffee brewing in my life. I switched from using the Keurig, which has the hassle of waste with the K-Cups and Filters (bad for the environment) and the expensiveness of each, to the AeroPress. Now, I'm not worried about either of those issues of waste and expense, because the minimalist design and use of paper filters has blown all other options out of the water. The time to make a cup of coffee might be slightly longer than it takes the Keurig to squirt out a K-Cup's contents, but that means nothing when you know you're contributing to the well-being of the Earth and to other people, while saving money all in one go.

Also, if you're into canning, it fits an impressive amount of jars.<br /><br />*Original*<br />I'm not entirely sure this purchase was necessary, but I'm enjoying my new toy. I live by myself and work about 13-15 hrs per day 6 days a week so, I'm not home much to create too many dishes. But, the few dishes I do dirty up tend to sit (rinsed) in the sink for a few days before I get the time or energy to wash them. So far, it's been really nice to just rinse and shove in the dishwasher until there's enough to run it. I also really love that I don't have to install it with a water line. It takes a very small amount of water ( I think under a gallon and a half) so it's definitely less than I would use hand washing. I have a very small kitchen, and I like that the footprint is reasonably small. I love that it heats the water internally and has a top and bottom sprayer, as well as a dry program. I had one in my cart that was only $50 cheaper and didn't have a top sprayer, heater, or dry function. I'm really glad I searched around a bit, because I think that $50 extra was well spent. I have noticed that my dishes tend to come out with a bit of a film that I have to polish off, which is why I'm not sure it's quite the time saver I was hoping it would be. Maybe I should just switch my detergent. I've seen reviews where they pile WAY more inside than I do and rave about the cleanliness of the dishes when they come out, so I'm a little confused at that. From my experience, you need to be very careful to position your dishes so the water can actually hit them.<br /><br />Be aware, it's still just a small dishwasher. It's not a magic portal that zaps food particles into the ether. You will still need to rinse your dishes after using them. I work in a professional kitchen and even our commercial dishwasher isn't that magical. I think this product is for a niche market and will work well for some, but may not suit the average household. Overall, I'm happy. It works very well for my living situation.",Works well for me,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1SAg90tyaS._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1SAg90tyaS._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/B1SAg90tyaS._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B089YD3Z91

I am a residential contractor and ordered this Bull 11001 Stainless Steel under counter refrigerator to use in an outdoor kitchen under a covered patio.

It runs and gets cool but not cold.<br /><br />The problem is that due to normal construction delays we did not even open the box until after the return period had expired.

AGEIVNUJUBCBWDMAWK2VDXDWVKXQ,B002UYSHMM,5.0,1311741907000,True,4,"I, like others, dithered for nearly a year before making the decision to purchase this appliance.  I'd been getting by with a hand-cranked &#34;Wonder Washer&#34; but an increase in weekly laundry made using that option a bit onerous.  I read all the reviews here several times, and Lou's wonderful report with video is pretty doggone accurate and was the thing that finally pushed me over the edge (after reading/watching it five or ten times!).<br /><br />The box containing the appliance arrived in good shape--it was purchased from Amazon and shipped via Target--but for those trying to hide their purchase from their landlord, the box had a large picture of the machine on it in full color.  It wasn't an anonymous beige box, not by a long shot.<br /><br />I followed the instructions (using tips I'd picked up from reading all these Amazon reviews) and got the thing set up toute suite.  I agree that having an electric drill makes putting on the bottom plate much easier--it went on without too much fuss and lined up well, but I could see where doing it manually might be a bit of a 'drill,' pardon the expression.  I had zero difficulty with the hoses--didn't need to move the discharge hose from one side to another, so that was a plus, and the washing machine 'fill' hose screws on with no drama.  The fittings to hook the hose to the faucet went on an underused sink in the bathroom with no issues.  The hose clips on the faucet fitting snugly with no leaks.<br /><br />I have to say that I can't believe how WELL this machine works.  Despite its small size, it can do a decent load of wash--just don't pack the stuff in and don't be greedy.  A normal cycle is just over a half hour, and the clothes come out quite clean.  For people who are complaining that their spin cycle isn't working or they have water remaining in their machine, I would suggest they ensure that their machine is level before assuming it's defective.  My machine spins my clothing so well that everything is dry in no time on an outdoor line, and the polyester stuff is almost dry as I pull it  out of the machine.  My machine is also quite quiet--and I'm betting this is because I have it positioned on a level surface.<br /><br />If I had anything to gripe about, I'd say the smell of the hose is pretty nasty at first blush.  It smells like burnt 'something or other.'  The stink does dissipate over time, though, and it's not enough of a sticking (or stinking) point to cause me to lower my five-star grade on this item.<br /><br />The price of this beauty has come down a good deal since I first started coveting it, and the price I paid was around two hundred bucks plus state tax (the order fulfiller, Target, does business in my state).  So far, I have no complaints as to the delivery, the way the machine works, or the price.  I wish I'd bought this thing sooner!<br /><br />I am editing this review to add that I've had this item about a month, now, and I am even happier with it today than I was after the first week!  When I think of the number of times I threw ten to fifteen bucks at a fetid laudromat, I regret having dithered about making this purchase.  The &#34;hose stink&#34; I mentioned above is totally gone, the machine is doing a dozen loads a week without breaking a sweat, and I am overjoyed with it.  At this rate it will pay for itself in no time.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've now owned this machine for five and a half years (my, how time flies).  I only use it during the summer months and the occasional weekend, as I have it at a holiday home, but when I am using it, I am using it a lot (several times a week, sometimes more than one load) and it continues to work superbly.  This is probably one of my top five purchases from Amazon.",Better Than I'd Hoped It Would Be!,[],B002UYSHMM

First pic shows my first espresso made from nespresso pod, and the resultant crema in the cup.  I then tried the Capmesso top on the pod (which, btw, is a struggle to get the foil film off of!!), which I had filled with a Turkish coffee grind I had.  I got about 5 drips out of the cycle,  and realized the Turkish grind was too fine, water was not going through the pod.  So refilled with a regular, slightly fine, grind of my normal drip coffee.  Second picture shows the result.  Just slightly less crema, might be due to the grind, but worked great and the strength of the espresso was par with the actual nespresso pod.

The fan is powerful and effective, and smooth running. The stainless steel is solid, as is the general construction. The lights, as everyone has commented, are a joke. Just for decoration really. Don't know how easy it would be to replace them as they are LEDs and in a sealed container.<br /><br />The contractor had to get the upper sleeve trimmed down at a metal shop in order to fit our low (91-inch) Cape-style ceilings. I wanted the lowest part of the hood to be at least 69 inches off the ground to avoid collisions with my forehead. So some trimming was necessary.  It contains a much more powerful fan (turbo-style) for far less money than the ones sold by the big-name appliance makers. And with a little ingenuity I think this hood can be adapted to almost any situation. The fan has a very smooth sound, and electronic controls are nice too. There are 3 clearly marked speeds. If you hit the off button, it gives you a 1-minute delay before turning off.  If you want it off right away, hit the speed-button that you used to turn it on, or hit the off-button twice. Very simple and intuitive. The stainless steel is solid, but the usual pain in the A to keep clean. (Glad we got the new Smudge-proof stainless finish on our Frigidaire appliances. It shows a lot less fingerprints.)<br /><br />I would have preferred a slightly less space-age style, but I didn't see anything more appropriate. We got cherry cabinets in a deep red/brown wood  finish and stainless appliances for a kind of mixed traditional/modern style. Maybe the similar AKDY model with the flat glass would have  worked better . . . Should'a, could'a, would'a.  That's my refrain for the first 6 to 8 months on all home improvement projects. After a year I get used to it, and wonder why I ever wanted anything different. Same with new clothes.","Solid and works great, though lights are just for decoration",[],B005HK6OP8

I bought this unit 2 years and 6 months ago as a part of a massive kitchen renovation that took a handful of months.  Almost 2 years to the day after installation, there was a major issue with the motor or the speed control.  Not 100% certain because I had TERRIBLE support service from Broan.  I called support - spoke to a guy for 10 minutes.  Carefully explained the issue.  The guy had no clue how to do his job and couldn't tell me which $100+ part was failing.  So his last ditch effort to get out of doing his job was was to send me a new blower assembly (even though my unit was out of warranty).  He asked me, &#34;how long have you had the unit.&#34;  My response was, &#34;about 2 years.&#34;  He said since it was close to the 1 year warranty, he was going to send me the part free of charge... Great news! All I had to do was send him my receipt and a photo of the serial number.  I sent him the Amazon receipt and the photo to his email address.  I get a response about an hour later: &#34;I'm sorry sir, but I will not be able to send out the repair parts for you. The range hood only has a one year warranty and I was stretching it when you told me that it was only two years old. The receipt shows it is actually just over 2-1/2 years old. The blower assembly is part number SV08097 and it includes the motor, blower wheel, scroll housing, & capacitor. You can get this part through our Customer Service Department at 800-558-1711.&#34;<br /><br />Thanks for the support!

It's easily installed and a perfect fit.  We're on our second replacement filter this year using this exact brand and would tell you if your humidifier seems like it just can't keep up like it did when it was new, swap out your filter and see instant results.  The only real knock I have with this filter is the longevity--the original humidifier filter (using the same tap water) lasted nearly a whole winter season.  These replacement filters are luck to last a month before becoming mineral saturated to the point where water apparently doesn't wick very well.  We are using a vinegar/water cleaning solution as other reviews have suggested to clean these filters which seems to work fairly good at restoring the filter to usability.  We add a couple of cups of vinegar to approx. 3 gallons of water in a 5 gallon bucket and then totally submerge the filter leaving it overnight.  Rinse, dry, and the filter is ready to use again.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good filter despite its longevity issues at a fair price.  The cleaning vinegar rinse is a good mitigation strategy to increase the filter's useful life but can be a hassle in the winter.",Great Initial Performance But Mineral Clogs Quickly Shorten Life Span,[],B01LWAPPVI

Can fit quite a lot of clothing which surprised me. How ever the frame and handle seem very wobbly be sure to use one hand to support the base. Highly suggest getting a spin dryer (I purchased the nina soft which can handle the amount of clothes that the wonder wash can) with this item it makes the whole routine much easier by allowing you to spin out the soapy dirty water and then spin out the excess water before hanging to dry. Was Able to wash a very large pile of clothes all by hand in a similar amount of time that my washing machine can. Some water ended up in my counter when filling and emptying the wonder wash but I'm sure this will be minimal after practice.

AEGVNYAOFWSYDP4LFGGYKNFIVLLA,B071NM6ZR8,1.0,1496780100000,True,4,"I have mixed feelings on this product.<br /><br />On positive side: It is made of 0.7mm stainless steel, has baffled filter, has rather good two squirrel cage 3-speed AC motors which are not as quiet as I expected, but OK compared to my NuTone range hood, it has quality mechanical design and good screws. Certainly NOT &#34;Ultra Quiet&#34;, but acceptable.<br /><br />On negative side: it has too dim, non-replaceable LED lights with a bit blue (&#34;daylight&#34;) color that barely illuminate the range surface and make meats look a bit un-fresh - absolutely unacceptable for the kitchen. Certainly NOT &#34;Ultra Bright&#34;. I thought that it comes with GU10 halogen bulbs which I can immediately replace, but... read entire review. Its baffle filter has mounting notches that leave to thin metal strip which breaks apart - one of the filters I got was broken, and another shows that it was broken and then welded in the weak place. And I expected it to be even a bit more quiet.<br /><br />When I was looking for the range hood, I wanted the following features (scores for this hood in brackets): under cabinet (ok), sturdy nice looking stainless steel (ok), &#60;40 dBA at 150cfm (close to OK), squirrel cage fans (ok) with brushless DC motors (not ok) and variable electronically controlled speed (not OK), with bright warm white LED lights (not OK) and ability to replace bulbs (not ok), and with complete disconnect on/off switch (not OK) and at price point of $250 (OK).  All these features are doable today at the specified price point, but I could find only this one which was closest.<br /><br />The first thing I did is replaced the LED lights with 7W 450 lm MR16 12V LED bulbs naively. It was possible although the seating for the bulb is made incompatible and the retaining ring cannot be used. I immediately had perfect illumination of the range. But it causes overload of the 12V supply transformer (? why they decided to use 12V bulbs when 120V LEDs are available?) and the power transformer burned out. These proud Cycene designers were not thinking enough. When I disassembled it (assembly quality was very good), I found that it has provisions for two types of bulbs - 120V AC and 12V DC. 12V DC max current is 0.5A total. So I did the work for them and upgraded it to 12V switcher supply for controls and relays, and used GU10 120V 7W warm while led bulbs now which ARE &#34;Ultra Bright&#34; and fit perfectly into the mounting holes and retaining rings, and have no limitation on power. It costed me $5 for sockets and $7 for bulbs. This upgrade eliminated design deficiencies and now I have a nice range hood.<br /><br />The other thing is the clock - it runs away by 15mins a day. I did not pay attention to it first, but it is really annoying to have several clocks in the house showing different time. The deeper inspection shows that the microcontroller, BS82D20, does not have crystal oscillator enabled due to firmware bug(!), although the crystal is installed on the board. I think that these designers were D-graders in college or simply had no experience. Wonder how it went into production unnoticed!<br /><br />Summary: If you are an electrical engineer and can do the some rework, you may buy it as a base kit to work on. If you want to just use it &#34;as is&#34;, don't buy!",A kit for parts to do custom upgrade. Light is too weak for cooking and does not make meat look fresh.,[],B071NM6ZR8

Got tired of banging on the door/opening closing, pressing &#34;start/stop&#34; over and over to do a single load of laundry.  This is the exact part replacement for my LG Tromm WM1812CW.  So far, (with about 5 loads of laundry), I've not noticed any problems at all with the new part.  So that either means that I had a faulty Door Lock sensor, or something else was going on.  Either way, no issues with this part.<br /><br />As someone mentioned, you can replace it by only unscrewing 6 screws total (4 for the top to slide the top of the washing machine off, and 2 that hold this part in place.  However, it's a pretty tight space to reach down into.  I'm 6'4 and didn't have any problems reaching the part to replace it, but it was fiddly to actually replace.  The cable connector was the hard part.  There's a small lever-lock on the connector, just make sure it's depressed before you start to separate the connector from the latch.  It's fiddly, and I had to wiggle it for a few minutes, but be persistent, and it does eventually unlatch without problems.  New part fit just fine, reinstalled, and no more &#34;dE&#34; errors.  So, bonus!<br /><br />It _might_ be easier to replace with the LG tool that is sold separately, but it's probably not required.

Seriously!  It's destructive and could even possibly start a fire.  So you order this new lint screen, and you buy some duct tape, and every time you start a load that isn't towels, you put a piece of duct tape over that gap.  Oh, you can also use wire snips or a Dremel to cut away the lip there, which reduces but does not eliminate the problem, so... duct tape it is.  Serious design flaw in this otherwise terrific dryer.","Exact replacement, same design defect",[],B07D7B2ZG5

Fearing that I may end up getting a used repackaged product (as mentioned in some of the negative reviews) I made sure to pick up a TDS* water meter/tester as well. Not only to make sure I got a new filter from this seller, but also so I can test the various liquids used around my home.<br /><br />As I'd mentioned in my review for the TDS* water meter/tester, my tap water is hard so I used the baseline measurement (PPM's) of a bottle of Poland Spring water. My main concern about this filter or my refrigerator water line in general, was that it wasn't going to make too much of a difference drinking water from the tap versus one that came out of this filter. After my baseline measurements, my concerns were put at ease.<br /><br />Below are results from my tests:<br /><br />(measurements in PPM)<br />0-50 = Ideal drinking water<br />50-100 = Carbon filtered water<br />100-200 = Hard water<br />200-300 = Marginally acceptable<br />200-400 = Average tap water<br />400+ Very high TDS contaminant level<br /><br />--My household baseline--<br />Bottle of Poland Spring = 18<br />Tap Water = 281<br />Gatorade = 260<br />5 month old filter from my refrigerator water line = 240<br />New filter from my refrigerator water line = 200<br />Melted ice (4 hours) = 293<br /><br />So what did I learn from this... My tap water isn't too bad, this particular filter can probably go another month or two, and I really need to clean my ice maker. The good news is that this filter removed 80+PPM's of TDS* from my tap.<br /><br />*TDS* - Total Dissolved Solids are the total amount of mobile charged ions, including minerals, salts, or metals dissolved in a given volume of water.","Good, but could be better.",[],B000AST3AK

The reusable pod is quite hot when you take it out of the machine , I would recommend leaving it to cool for awhile unless you need to make another cup of coffee immediately but use caution if taking it out immediately ..

We were skeptical at first, but it really does the job.  The washer is MUCH quieter and doesn't walk a few inches with every load.  The tricky part is the installation.  Keep in mind that we are senior citizens and the  install required my husband to tilt the machine while I'm on the floor with a grabber getting the cushions on the washer feet.  Once we figured out the rear pads, the front ones were pretty easy.  That's the reason for only 2 stars on installation.

If you're okay with that, it's not a problem.  The single set will keep your washer from vibrating as much.  We did order a second set to raise the dryer.  My chest freezer is also in the laundry room and I use the tops of the machines as a staging area when I need to get an item from the bottom of the freezer.  The baskets that I use work better on an even surface.  But for the fact that I use the tops of my washer and dryer for other things, the slight height difference isn't a problem.

It was overpriced, often is unbalanced and this is the second time this year that i've changed the washer drain pump assembly.  The last time i had to order the part and it cost twice the price.  Probably because it was a samsung part.  This doesn't seem like it is, however, it's half the price and so far works well.  My last part lasted about 8 months so time will tell...  I do a lot of laundry (at least 1-2 loads per day).  I'll update this post should i have issues.<br /><br />For folks wondering if this is a ""big job"" left for repair technicians - the answer is NO.  I am a mom that works full time, watches some YouTube videos and with a little elbow grease, changed this myself.  It took some time the first time (about an hour) so that i could clean up the water that spilled all over the floor from being stuck in the machine.  The second time (last week) it took me 10 minutes to change this bad boy out (after the clean up).  It is simple and to pay a technician $650 (yes - that is right... that is what they wanted to charge me for repairing my machine.<br /><br />A little elbow grease and $50 and you should be set.  Just know that you'll know its the drain pump when your washer turns on and you hear a buzz.  Nothing happens to the water even if you just hit spin... Most times it's the pump but could be a clog (both times for me it's the pump).  Good luck!!!!<br /><br />I also will say that the package was shipped SUPER fast.  I had it within 2-days.

Purchased seven months ago when our in-house filter no longer vented to the outside and we were unable to repair at that time. This was easy to install and sits on top of our dryer. It is made in China so is overpriced for what you get and subsequent issues. Was well-packaged and arrived undamaged.<br /><br />Pros: works well indoors as it keeps lint from going throughout the house; use proper grade venting duct for safety reasons as the air gets very hot.<br /><br />Cons: Plastic construction with wire mesh screen attached to inside of removable panel. Bottom drawer which holds water does not stay closed after a few months' use and I have to keep drawer in place with rubber bands. The handle does not remove most of the lint so I do it by hand.<br /><br />Our laundry room is in the middle of our our home and our thermostat is located on the wall directly outside the laundry room. Poor planning on someone's part! I do not keep the laundry room door closed while the dryer is working and as the dryer now vents hot air inside the home, it causes false readings on the thermostat so we have to make frequent adjustments for heating/cooling.<br /><br />My biggest issue is quality does not match high cost. It does the job which is to trap lint. That's the most positive thing I can say. If we are unable to eventually have the original up the wall, through the attic and outside vent replaced, and I find myself needing another indoor unit, I will check other options before purchasing this again.","Overpriced, but does an ok job",[],B008RNPOIU

I used to bring their bed covers to the laundromat about 15-20' driving from my home. Each time it costed me over $10-15 just to wash them alone. However, recently I do not foster as much as I used to due to the birth of my 3rd baby (I have my hands full). Also, we adopted one of our foster dogs, she is old and she gets jealousy with just about any other animals around us (including the cat we have had for 5 years). For all that reasons, I keep my foster baby at 1 or 2 only and they stay at the back house. I got this washer/dryer combo to wash their bed covers which usually are old bed sheets. This washer fits about 2-3 king sized bedsheets depending how thick the materials are. The dryer, though, would only be comfortable to fit just one king sized bed sheet. I expected that already so I don't mind. I hang dry them under sun anyway. We have 4acres lot so sun is everywhere even during the winter :) that was my intend from the beginning to save electric. Of course, buying a standard sized washer, maybe even an used one from the FB Marketplace, would be even cheaper than buying this whole set and fits a lot more to wash at one time BUT my back house is not designed to set up a regular washer so yes, that was the very main reason I chose these compact washer/dryer. They serve their purpose, though. They are very easy to use as well and do not take too much space, obviously. I have had them for over a month and they are still running great every week.

So I will still be on the lookout for one more unique color besides the traditional purple or black.<br /><br />Overall I have been in love. This has solved the problem I had with organizing all my flavored drinks. Now I don’t have to guess or open one up every time to figure out what it is. I use a filter in them because teeccino is much heavier than coffee so it’s harder to clean these pods, but with a filter everything just comes right out easily. The flavor is nice and bold still and so far I haven’t had any issues with it fitting in my moms b40 kuerig nor in my K-elite. Once I get another carousel or if more colors come out, I will buy again. Maybe a set of 7 pastels? I would be totally okay with buying 5 more sets if the company were to make a set of pastels or even neutral shades. (White, Cream, tan, brown, mauve, light grey, dark grey?)",So far these have worked out well,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JyJYIVM8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JyJYIVM8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JyJYIVM8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WQUOU5QXL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WQUOU5QXL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81WQUOU5QXL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01ENXS1C8

Put it on some rubber feet and close to the sink and it will be easier to manage.  The fill hose doesnt fit my sink so I have a bucket I use to fill the tub.  The drain hose is long enough to reach the sink.  You do have to fill/empty/ spin (wash)/ fill/empty/spin (rinse) each load so be prepared for a little manual labor.  Dont expect to do full loads in this.  Two adult tops and two adult shorts is about a load for this machine. This is great for underwear and probably baby/kid stuff (I dont have small humans).

I saw this one and it looked perfect.  Rest assured that what you see is what you get - only it looks even better in my kitchen (see picture).<br />Sadly, I cannot give you many installation tips, because I had an expert installer put it in for me, who was an expert in all of the ""trades"", but I did watch and help a little.  The end result was more beautiful than I imagined. He did mention that the installation manual was vague, the picture on front didn't even match my model, and I think the instructions say to mount it to the sheetrock - which we didn't think was nearly sturdy enough.  It's a heavy, steel piece, so we came up with a new plan.  He built a wood box frame, with the thickness of three 2""x4""'s, and secured that in my attic, and attached my new range hood to it.  I could practically swing from it, now (but don't try that at home).  We also used almost all of our own screws - with the renovation going on, I had plenty of additional hardware and tools on hand.<br />Because my ceiling was lower (8ft) in the kitchen, our unit didn't need such a long ""neck"" - but the 2 steel rectangular sleeves that come with it are meant to be ""nested"", so we had to cut both pieces almost in half but, because my installer was an expert, he made it look great - as you can see by the picture!<br />If you must have something blocking your newly opened view (we tore down a wall, between the kitchen and living room), then it should be this beauty!<br />It has 4 well-placed lights, one on each corner, for ""full food disclosure"" - it really lights up my stove top!.  As a personal preference, I've already replaced my little lights with the LED white light version of the bulbs, because I like more white light and less yellow light - purely my choice - but I wanted people to know that replacement bulbs are easy to find.  I bought them right off the shelf at my local hardware store, in the specialty lighting area.<br />All 4 speed settings of the fan work great and, of course, the higher the setting, the noisier the fan - but the more vacuum power you'll get, for getting rid of the smoke (not that I ever burn anything)(maybe once or twice) (a month).  The lower speeds are pretty quiet compared to my old ""hoody"".<br />My old vent hood had knobs and it had 3 speeds, 1). noisy, 2). super noisy, 3). noisiest...I SAID NOISIEST!<br />This one is a touchscreen and I really like it.

So, I ordered it and lo-and-behold it didn't work worth a dang. It leaked around the top and spewed hot water everywhere.  It is important to tighten the cap all the way.  The problem as I saw it was that the gray insert didn't seal well against the top input nozzle.  So, I found a suitably sized o-ring at Home depot that would slide up the base of the reusable cup.  It only sits below the cap about a mm.  But just enough to push it up against the upper pin so that the top of the reusable cap seals against the top of the Keurig Brewer (tighter to the water input nozzle).  Now it brews perfectly.  No leaks , no mess, and a fresh cup o' java every time.  After experimenting and being satisfied with my fix, I applied 3 small dollops of super glue to the outside of the reusable base so the o-ring is semi-permanently attached.  Jeez, you'd think the mfg or the after-marketer of this reusable filter could figure this out and design the extra mm necessary to make it fit more snuggle against the nozzle.

Rating would be two stars if customer support offered ANY help, but instead told me because I've had it more than four months that I'm SOL. Still, it was nice while it lasted.<br /><br />I've currently washed about 10 ""loads"" in this washer and first impressions are that it's a great alternative to running to the laundromat or forking over $6 at the apartment's coin-op machines.<br />My typical washer load is two pairs of pants of either denim or scrub pants, a few pairs of underwear/socks, and two shirts. I need to spin dry them in three separate batches, however, but you can spin and wash at the same time so it isn't so bad.<br /><br />Pros - convenient! I don't need to leave my apartment to wash mine and my girlfriend's clothes! We need to do laundry a little more often than with a standard washer/dryer but as long as we hang up the spun-dry clothes the night before they are good as new the next morning.<br />Another pro is it's pretty simple to use! The instructions were very clearly not written by a native English speaker but it is pretty straightforward - put your clothes in, put your detergent in, fill about 1/2 - 3/4 with water, set it to wash for 15 minutes then drain. Now refill with water and put in fabric softener and wash for another 5 minutes. Drain the water one more time then move a small batch of wet clothes to the spin dryer (wring out as much water as you can before this step if it's having problems spinning) and let it do its thing for two or three spin cycles of 5 minutes just make sure to move around the clothes each spin. Hang up the almost dry clothes overnight and tomorrow morning you'll have clean laundry!<br /><br />Cons - loud! This machine rumbles and vibrates a LOT. A lot to the point where I place it on top of a few stacked bath mats to try to soften the sound it makes on the apartment beneath me. With the door closed and it in the adjacent room it is no louder than your standard washer/dryer machines but it can only handle about 1/3 of the total clothes at a time.<br />Another con is it uses quite a bit of water. Thankfully my landlord covers water but I could see this being a little wasteful especially if you use a lot of detergent/fabric softener.<br />Lastly the amount of clothes it can fit can be a problem. For someone who wears a lot of thick clothes or jeans this washer will slow down your laundry adventures but for my work clothes that are scrubs? This thing is FANTASTIC. I don't have much confidence that this washer can handle much bedding however.<br /><br />After crunching some numbers this portable washing machine is a pretty safe investment of around $200 if your laundromat/apartment washer/dryers are $6 a load like mine are.<br /><br />I give this gadget four clean socks out of five.",Six months for machine to break.

Regarding the square center hole: it is not the sealing interface the best I can tell, and it relies on the dimensions of the O-ring and outer diameter for seal-ability. I think if you change the filter once the fridge light comes on, you don't need to worry about the burst pressure rating, and its a mute point.

AG7NGEAOTXHQ5H6KAJKZNSVW45QQ,B08NCFVHTL,4.0,1616108097215,True,0,"Two weeks into using this dishwasher daily and so far so good. I'll update this review if that changes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Simple setup<br />Easy to use<br />Heats water up well<br />Surprisingly roomy inside<br />Door sensor<br />Water sensor<br />3 cycle settings<br />Auto-shut off<br /><br />Cons:<br />Unclear instructions<br />No detergent reservoir<br />Plastic fittings/cheap hose<br />No fan/drying function<br />Small & poorly placed utensil basket<br />No door latch<br /><br />Setup was super simple, the only assembly was connecting the hoses. We did need an adapter to connect to our sink faucet, but that was expected and the hardware store recommended a very nifty quick-release adapter for our sink. Make sure your connections are snug but not over-tightened as the connections are only plastic, and the hose needs a little clearance so don't let it get pinched. The intake hose is vinyl, but the drain hose is cheap plastic, it could crack if pinched at lot.  I would have liked to see better hoses. Also because the instructions were poorly translated and they really don't tell you much about the dishwasher's functions so you basically have to guess things for yourself.<br /><br />There is no designated area to put dishwasher detergent. We filled a spray bottle with diluted liquid dishwasher detergent and then we give our (pre-rinsed) dishes a quick, very light spray right before we start the load and that seems to work great. You don't need a lot as this is a tiny dishwasher.<br /><br />Speaking of tiny, I easily fit 6 dinner plates, 2 bowls, and 2 cups, plus some silverware into the first load. That's plenty for our 2-person household. I dislike the silverware tray, it's small and because your silverware is horizontal it doesn't get water between them very well unless you wash like... 2 forks at a time. I took the silverware wire basket from our draining rack and it happened to fit perfectly into the right side of the rack. That let me load silverware vertically and they get washed much better.<br /><br />You do absolutely need to make sure nothing slips below the rack! It has only one sprayer, the spinner in the bottom. If that gets stuck, nothing will get cleaned. Despite being only one sprayer, spraying from below, it does a pretty good job getting water everywhere inside. It sprays hard enough to ricochet the water off the top and sides, everything gets wets. Note that the door has strong hinges but no latch - nothing keeps you from prying open the door mid-wash cycle while the sprayer is spraying high pressure hot water everywhere. It does have a door sensor though, so it will shut off if opened. It also senses if you forgot to turn on the water faucet and beeps at you until you do!<br /><br />Noise level is okay, about what I expected.  It does well heating the water, you only need to hook up cold water and it heats it up pretty hot. You need to make sure you have some clearance on top - that's where the steam vent is. The instruction shows the other vent is for air, but if it's for drying it doesn't seem to do much of anything and the dishwasher seems to shut off once the washing is done - no fan/drying cycle. You need to either open it up to let them air dry, or take them out and dry them by hand. This is also why I knocked down a star - if it just ran a fan for a while to force air circulation after the wash cycle, that would have been great.  There is also a little drain trap in the back of the dishwashing space, to keep the hose from getting clogged which seems smart. It is easy to remove and dump out any junk it has caught.<br /><br />Overall we are very pleased with it. It's doing what we expected and helping us keep our dishes clean. It isn't a fancy super-heated high-pressure dishwasher, so we didn't expect miracles. It obviously won't scrub off 2-day dried-on gunk or burnt pans, but it handles our daily dishes perfectly well. If doing dishes every day is a bit of struggle for you, then this ain't a bad option.","Simple, uncomplicated and easy to use",[],B08NCFVHTL

I chose Fotile because it is a reputable brand in China and they are specialized in designing and manufacturing range hood. I trust them more than those European brands. I think they have more experience of dealing with high heat cooking, such as stir fry, etc. And my family in China had used Fotile products for years, they all love Fotile. Plus I love the appearance of this range hood. I love the contemporary stylish design.<br /><br />1. Suction power: Five stars. You can see clearly in the video clip.<br /><br />I cook stir-fried dishes, Indian Curry, pan fried meat all the time, this machine had never let me down. Before I had it, I had to open the windows in my kitchen and dining room to let the smell go away. After we installed this machine, unless I am leaning over the stove top,  I couldn't smell anything.<br /><br />2. Noise: Five Stars. When I had to make the decision between this one and the Broan range hood with exterior blower, one of my major concern about Fotile product was the noise. I downloaded a noise testing app to test, when it was running on high suction,  the noise was around 75dB. Of course, it was not tested under the ideal condition. I cannot isolate the background noise. The noise level is tolerable. Plus, I only need run it on high power when I am doing stir fry. It wouldn't last more than five minutes to complete the dish.In the other cooking situation, the medium power is sufficient to solve most of the problems.<br /><br />3. Easy to Clean: Five Stars.I usually take off the filter every two weeks and wipe off the excess grease on the filter then dump it into the dish washer.<br />I feel like they put some thing like Teflon coating on the interior surface. I spray some all purpose cleaner on the panel between the fans, the grease is really easy to be wiped off.<br /><br />-----------------------------Things they can improve--------------------------------<br />4.I wish the color temperature of the LED light bulbs could be 3000(warm light) instead of 6000(daylight). Daylight makes my food looks pale.<br /><br />5.The installation is not so DIY friendly. I think the designers could refer to the design of over the range microwave to see how they hang the machine.<br /><br />We installed this range hood by ourselves, including hanging the machine on the wall, anchoring it on the cabinet, modifying the cabinet, and setting up the air duct.Amazon's installation service only covers hanging the machine on the wall. I have consulted with some contractors, they would charge me over one thousand dollars for the project. If you want to DIY, you need to be comfortable with operating power tools, know how to find the studs and so on. If you don't have the basic knowledge about your home's structure, this project would be quite hard for you to accomplish. Another tip is most home power drills are not powerful enough to drive a 6-inch hole saw.You need commercial grade drill to drill such a big hole on your cabinet or you can see the picture how we managed to drill those holes.<br /><br />It dosesn't have any spare hardware. The screws are in metric. We lost one screw during installation, but local hardware stores don't carry this sized screw. So we had to move the furniture and appliances away to look for this screw.",I trust them more than those European brands,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I9Qv3xioL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I9Qv3xioL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71I9Qv3xioL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B01MXEV2G3

AHWCLNQSSVF26246QTP45PODGFQQ,B001AQZI64,3.0,1484037059000,True,2,"First of all, we are limited by the nominal 12 volt power in a vehicle. This heater draws about 10 amperes, but that depends on the actual vehicle voltage. My vehicle will idle at about 14.5 volts, so it is able to put more power into the heater, so it boils water slightly faster. When the product description says &#34;glass or ceramic&#34; container, they mean it. If you try to use a metal container, the metal will radiate and waste heat. If you try to use something silly like foam plastic, it will likely melt. Plus, you want to choose the container volume carefully. If you use a large volume container, the heater coil will not sink down into the cold water far enough, so the whole thing will burn up and fail. We are trying to get some volume around 8 ounces to boil. If you try it with 6 ounces of cold water, it will boil relatively quickly. I found that I could get good results (about 8 minutes to boil) using 7 ounces of water in a glass/ceramic mug, and the heater coil sticks down into the cold water. YMMV. If your vehicle battery is different and if you have the heater plugged into a socket that is a long way from the battery over a poor choice of wire, then the power to the heater will be lower. Just don't make the mistake of letting the heater flip off of the mug lip. Then it will be out of the water, it will burn up, and fail. So, choose your pieces and parts carefully.","It works, but you want to be careful",[],B001AQZI64

In contrast, our Dreamiracle Countertop Ice Maker requires only minimal counter space (and can easily be moved to other locations or stored away), is completely self-contained (no water connection) and if it happens to break can be easily taken in for repairs or economically replaced. It's possible to bag and store the ice it produces, but because it can make enough fresh ice for a couple of iced teas or other drinks in just minutes and plenty of ice for a family gathering or small party on demand, we see no need to store it. The machine is almost eerily quiet in operation; when it's finished filling its ice basket it goes into a silent standby mode which consumes very little power.<br /><br />Our Dreamiracle Countertop Ice Maker has a self-cleaning cycle which can be invoked when we feel it is necessary; we're leaning toward a once-a-week routine just to keep everything working well. Dreamiracle recommends wiping the machine down manually, inside and out, every now and then, which fits in well with our usual cleaning schedule and takes very little time or effort. It's also recommended to empty the machine if it won't be used for a few days or longer, and fresh water should be used for the best tasting ice. All in all, the operational demands are minimal and basically just common sense.<br /><br />We find this Dreamiracle Countertop Ice Maker meets our needs perfectly, both in the kitchen and in the entertainment room. It produces a usable quantity of good-tasting ice quickly, is easy to operate, clean, and store, and requires nothing more than an AC outlet to use. The 120 watts it draws in operation is very economical and makes the machine usable almost anywhere. The convenience of fresh ice on demand in the kitchen or on the patio is hard to overstate. We love the Dreamiracle ice maker; now that we have it, we can hardly imagine how we got along without it.",Chill Appliance!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711H9aXkP4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711H9aXkP4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711H9aXkP4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717YDGl2pAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717YDGl2pAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/717YDGl2pAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719iUjVLhIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719iUjVLhIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719iUjVLhIL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U0jawCyBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U0jawCyBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71U0jawCyBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y3rJ5VK6L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y3rJ5VK6L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Y3rJ5VK6L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bmygmpq4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bmygmpq4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bmygmpq4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oSxp2FqHL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oSxp2FqHL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oSxp2FqHL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RP62e43iL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RP62e43iL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81RP62e43iL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B08YR8KB69

AGX4UQBHPZ7BMGKZNMOONFOJPWZA,B00097A4SW,1.0,1307062310000,False,4,"My landlord purchased this three years ago as a pair washer/dryer. Both have worked intermittently since day 1. Dryer has been repaired twice and washer once and the washer is already broken again.<br /><br />On it's best days, you have to push the buttons in just the right order, or it usually won't start. It never starts immediately when you push the ""Start"" button. It has a mind of its own where it randomly waits 3-5 minutes before starting. (I guess installing a frenetic personality on a washing machine makes it ""green"".) Some times it sounds like its starting, but you come back 2 hours later and it hasn't done anything.<br /><br />My roommates and I all have different rituals for trying to get it to start. Mine is to push start, open the door real quickly, close it, then push start again, then wait for the audible *click*. But my other roommates have their own rain dances, too.<br /><br />Sometimes it will forget to rinse or spin clothes. You can't see much through the tiny window, so when you open the door it spills two gallons of soapy water all over your floor. (Luckily I have tile floors. And lots of towels.)<br /><br />On the other end of the spectrum, some times it spins clothes waaaay too long. I was downstairs last week and could hear the spin cycle starting. I went out to grab a bit to eat and came back a few hours later thinking my clothes would be done and it WAS STILL SPINNING. It must have spun for 4 hours straight. I had to pull the plug on it because it doesn't respond to pushing buttons.<br /><br />Later in the week, my roommate started his laundry before work and came home to find it was stuck on the spin cycle. He also had to unplug it to stop it. It must have spun for over 8 hours! I can't believe it didn't burn out the motor spinning at high speeds for hours like that.<br /><br />As we speak, my latest batch of clothes are LOCKED INSIDE this stupid machine, and it has no emergency release, so my three brand new shirts that I haven't even worn yet are just sitting in their mildewing and smelling terrible.<br /><br />This is so bad I would recommend never to buy a whirlpool ever again. I don't care if my mom becomes a whirlpool sales person.I don't care if whirlpool donates 100% of the proceeds to saving kittens. It's unbelievably frustrating, really expensive to have repaired repeatedly, time consuming to troubleshoot, time consuming to take off of work every 6 months to wait for the repairman, etc.",Worst purchase ever of any type in any category,[],B00097A4SW

He sells them for $20 bucks cheaper than other vendors, and he delivers quickly.  But your switch may really not be dead... Read on<br /><br />I ordered a switch because my washing machine would fill, but not start. The very next day I found out, quite by accident I might add, that it would start if the lid was slammed hard enough (made a mental note; try kicking and slamming first). Anyway, th e slamming worked for awhile but like all easy fix's it eventually got to the point that it did not matter how hard one slammed the lid. It would not agitate.<br /><br />So, seeing as how I already had a new switch, I replaced the old switch with this new one. Figured I'd better do it now as the slamming was starting to take its tole, and I didn't want to have to replace the entire lid. Took me forever to figure how to get to it, but the replacing was really easy.  Amost immediately, the new switch started to behave like the old one. After some serious head scratching, and electrical checking, it turns out that my old switch was working just fine, and so may yours.<br /><br />All that was wrong was the lid hinge wire needs to be bent ever so slightly, to better engage the switch. I bent the wire a ""little more"", just to make sure it would never do this again, and left  the new switch in as long as I had it in there.

It worked okay, for just over 2 years, nothing special but not bad. Just a few months after the warranty expired the knob for the oven broke while the oven was on!

This oven has been well cared for and maintained in our home, there is no explanation for the break other than catastrophic defect.

The dishes are coming out sparkling clean. Follow the directions, use only a tablespoon of powdered dishwasher detergent and use the rinse assist product like Jetdry.

I don't have hard water so I am not using the salt and the instructions are limited on how to do that anyway. For those reviewers who stated it has standing water, make sure you install your waste line above that of your sink line. We watched a lot of videos on our new installation, did it ourselves and everything worked out well. Also, this unit is SUPER QUIET. We removed the attachments on the top drawer on one side as it prevented our tall coffee cups from fitting, but we find it useful on one side for cooking utensils to sit on.<br />What I don't like:<br />Really only one thing.

It requires no tools other than your hands and only took me about 60 seconds my first time doing it.<br /><br />After the new filter is installed, don't forget to do the last step in the instructions, which is to run 2.5 gallons of water through the fridge water dispenser and discard it. 2.5 gallons is actually quite a lot of water (about 5 straight minutes of water pouring out of my fridge) and may be overkill, but I didn't want to risk it and still followed it as they said. You can clearly see in the first couple glasses worth that you discard, that the water is a little &#34;grainy&#34; looking as the filter cleans itself out.

I can confirm that the pod gives off the crema expected from the Nespresso machine with this Stainless Steel Refillable Capsules - I haven't tried with the regular coffee grind.<br /><br />What comes in the set.<br />About (120? )Paper sleeves have 6 adhesive caps, heavy duty tamper, brush, 3 extra pod gasket, 3 steel pods.<br /><br />Pros: Crema, taste, cost-effective in the long run, mix your own coffee grind or espresso, easy to wash.<br /><br />Downside: Cleaning out the grinds (this is expected for reusables!). be mindful when you need to reorder caps before you run out(not sure how much to replenish the caps are.

AEIJ7U6YLQ25OUTXKZCDV4BHB76Q,B0BRN9S4QX,2.0,1516297595670,False,16,"Do not buy this range hood from this company.<br />We recently bought this model online and installed by a local handyman officially designated by Fotile. The number one reason we wanted to buy this brand was because it was advertised to be much quieter. But this is not true. The fan noise is loud even when set at medium level. It's not quiet at all compared to 妈妈乐 PACair brand. I think it's louder compared to similar 妈妈乐 PACair models.<br />The air flow speed and the suction force are mediocre at best, although the fan makes loud noise. I can't even tell if it does a better job than my old microwave range hood which was replaced by this expensive toy. Not impressed at all.<br />Then I found the stainless steel grease filter cannot be removed on this range hood. According to the owner's manual, the grease filter should easily come out if I hold both ends of the filter and pull it forward, but it simply doesn't come out no matter how hard I pull it and how many ways I wiggled it.<br />Then I found this company doesn't have any customer service at all in USA. I called their national customer service number 1-888-3150366 many times, but absolutely no one answers the phone. I also called the New Jersey phone number 973-644-4900 on their product warranty registration card for numerous times, and absolutely no one answers the phone either. Both numbers don't have voice mail boxes and you get no chance to leave voice messages.<br />This Fotile range hood is much more expensive than other brands. I expected it would do better, but I'm very disappointed with the product and the company's customer service. This company's customer service is a joke.<br />Overall, this product doesn't worth the money and the troubles.<br /><br />Update on 1/20/2018<br />We figured out how to remove the grease filter after we asked for help in Wechat. The reason I failed to remove it many times in the beginning was mainly because I didn't know the exact locations of the snap-in lock pins and the correct angle to pull it out. The grease filter on this range hood model has two snap-in type of lock pins located on the top edge of the filter, and each is about 2 inches from the left and right end, respectively. To be exact, they are located right at the top end of the second air intake opening/slot from each end of the grease filter. When you try to remove the filter, you would need to grab the filter at both ends and apply your force at these two spots where the snap-in pins are positioned, and then pull it toward you with a 45 degree angle. Do no pull it forward horizontally or pull it downward vertically. You may need to use a significant amount of force to get it out for the first time.<br /><br />Update on 6/10/2018<br />After I posted this review the Fotile customer service called me a couple of times to discuss the issue and the solution. I do appreciate that Fotile has upgraded their customer service telephone system. I haven't tried the new numbers yet.<br />The first installed duct pipe was a very soft and sloppy aluminum type. So the solution was to replace the duct pipe with a better one. Some time later the unhappy installer came in to replace it with an aluminum duct pipe but this one is more rigid. I figure a galvanized steel round metal duct pipe as suggested by the Fotile customer service would be better, but the installer didn't give me one. Steel pipe is harder to install, which is understandable. After this remodel the fan noise is slightly lower than before. Now we normally use the medium speed and are getting more used to the noise. At high speed the noise is still way too loud, while at low speed the air suction is inadequate.<br /><br />I watched the videos posted by other reviewers here. In one video the fan noise is quite loud, perhaps as loud as mine. In other videos the fan noise is acceptable. But of course this also depends on which fan speed you use.","Aluminum duct pipe got upgraded, now getting used to the noise",[],B01MXEV2G3

I purchased both the 8 oz. and 2.5 oz. versions of this CAPMESSO Coffee Capsule. We're using these in a Breville Nespresso Vertuo machine. Followed all instructions to the letter. Burned through a can of iIly beans trying to get a decent cup from either size capsule. Out of dozens of attempts, only got one 3 oz. cup from the 2.5 oz. capsule that was acceptable strength approaching what comes from the standard OEM Nestle Nespresso Vertuo capsule. Very disappointed. Even tried cleaning the flat metal surface / rim of capsule with 70% Isopropyl Alcohol to remove all oils before placing fold lid on the capsule. No luck. The steel capsule cup design is great but the foil lid will not stay on the capsule throughout brewing sequence. This is absolutely critical when capsule is pressurized during machine brewing cycle. Until the lid adhesive and capsule metal rim surface (its too smooth) are greatly improved and optimized, this is a DO NOT PURCHASE item.  If you are like me, you'll try the other offering from CAPMESSO (latest version 2022) - yeah, the all steel one with a screw-on lid with pre-drilled holes (rather than foil)... Don't bother.  That design doesn't work either unless you enjoy coffee flavored water and wasted high quality espresso beans. And we tried all kinds of coffee grinds from our conical burr grinder too.  Sure wish this worked but it isn't ready for the market yet. Great idea - poor execution. Yes its made in China.  Need I say more?

AHHLC3Y5YUPBM4OC2CTWPFMXLXYA,B07R4RHC4H,5.0,1579985851995,True,56,"We purchased the Samsung front load dryer in 2010 and in 2015 it wouldn't heat.  I bought a Heating Element, watched videos showing the step by step repair and switched out the element (the old one had a break in the coil) - easy!  When it stopped heating again in Sept 2016, I was overconfident and just installed a new Heating Element.  The dryer still wouldn't heat and I couldn't see where the old one had any type of failure.  So I took out the voltmeter and tried to figure out if the thermistor or thermostat, connected to the heating element side, was bad (I didn't realize at the time that there's 2 of each). Back to the store to buy the part that I guessed was bad - I installed it and it worked!<br />In July 2019, the dryer stopped heating again!  This time I wanted to see what was bad before I started replacing parts, so I took the dryer apart and saw one of the wires connected to the heating element was burnt and separated from the terminal (see red wire in 1st picture) . I looked up replacement parts online and found that all the wires in the entire dryer are on one wire harness, which was pricey. I also didn't want to attempt that repair, so back to the part's store where I showed them the terminal and wire to see if they had anything I could splice in.  They did!  It was a part for a different brand dryer and it had copper wire, so I had to buy a special connector for copper to aluminum wire splice (see purple box in 2nd picture).<br />Now it's Jan 2020 and the dryer wouldn't heat AGAIN! After opening the dryer back up I saw the other wire connected to the heating element was burnt (compare blue wire in each picture). Researching the problem online I realized I was the root cause of the problem - if you don't ensure the terminals are snug to the Heating Element then excess heat can cause the wires to overload and burn. I searched on amazon and found the same wire connection repair kit, but this one had aluminum wire so I was able to use the regular twist connector.  The part is for whirlpool and it's called a ""Dryer Heating Element Wire Adaptor Connecting Kit 279457"".  But, I'm writing about this so you won't have to buy it.  When your Samsung Dryer won't heat (and your wires aren't burnt)- just buy this kit and replace everything (Heating Element and all 4 thermistors/thermostats) so you don't have to guess which part is bad and replace them one by one.  When I replaced the second burnt wire the dryer still wouldn't heat.  I saw this kit and for the price it's easier to replace all the parts at once so you don't waste your time.  The burnt wire probably caused another part to fail but there was no need to determine what exactly happened as I replaced all the parts and now the dryer works again.  AND, make sure you use a plyers to snug down the wire terminals connected to the Heating element coils, just enough so they aren't loose.","Replace it all with this kit, it's easier.... but make sure the terminals aren't loose","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bUWaS4oFL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bUWaS4oFL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71bUWaS4oFL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rAOFjKarL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rAOFjKarL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71rAOFjKarL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07R4RHC4H

We have gone back for more multiple times because we now prefer to pass these back and forth with customers as opposed to the flimsier dozen containers we otherwise use. We provide eggs for a local restaurant and were looking for something that was sturdy and easy to clean/sanitize. These have absolutely fit the bill! They stack well and allow multiple layers to securely be on top of one another. I can easily carry 10 dozen eggs without worrying about dropping them because they don't slide like standard dozen egg cartons. They for large chicken eggs, but are not large enough to fit a full 24 duck eggs. They are generally tall enough to accommodate duck eggs, but can only hold 20-22 depending on the size of the duck eggs. They are not tall enough to hold double yolk chicken eggs, but nothing fits those well. The tabs that keep them closed are easier to break then I would like, but generally given the size, it is natural to pick them up from the bottom anyway so this does not pose much of a problem for us. Many of our cartons have been passed back and forth for several months and the only wear you can see is the few broken tabs.

The box says to just rinse from the bottom for 10 seconds. I just changed to one of the new filters a few days ago. I am already using filtered water from my refrigerator's water dispenser, my coffee maker is only 2 months old, and I can definitely tell a difference in the taste of the coffee since changing the filter.  The last few weeks it had been tasting a little bitter, that's why I ordered these filters.

I'd go thru five ice cube trays in less than two days; the trays took up a lot of freezer space, were awkward and messy. This ice maker solved my ice problems beautifully. My video shows how it works. Draining the ""leftover"" water is a bit annoying since you can't just move the ice maker over the sink; removing/replacing the drain plug is awkward. The only area at a freezing temp is the rods where the ice forms, so you can't leave the ice cubes in the ice maker.. Once the ice drops into the bin, the ice gets moist. When you empty the bin into a container in your regular freezer, the ice fully freezes and sticks together. An ice pick is very helpful to break the ice apart once it's frozen solid in your freezer (I found a very nice covered ice pick at Amazon!). The ice maker has a setting for small or large cubes, but I don't notice much difference. Each time you fill the ice maker, it takes 30-90min for the bin to fill with ice. After you remove and replace the bin, the next batch of ice comes faster. Those are minor issues compared with the ease and convenience of not fiddling with ice cube trays! I very, very highly recommend this ice maker!!",I sooo needed this ice maker!!,[],B071J2LSQS

These gap fillers are made of heat-resistant stainless steel and are easy to clean, which makes them a convenient addition to your kitchen.<br /><br />However, while there are some positive aspects to this product, there are also some negative reasons why you may want to reconsider purchasing them. Firstly, the retractable length of the gap fillers is limited to 13.8"" to 27.5"", which may not fit all types of stoves and countertops. This means that you may end up having gaps on either side of the fillers, defeating the purpose of having them in the first place.<br /><br />Another drawback of these gap fillers is that they are not very durable. Some users have reported that the stainless steel easily scratches and dents, and that the product may not last very long. This means that you may end up having to replace them sooner than you expected, which can be an inconvenience.<br /><br />Finally, while the silver color may look nice at first, it is prone to showing fingerprints and smudges, which can make your kitchen look dirty and unappealing. This means that you may end up spending more time cleaning the gap fillers than you would like.<br /><br />You need to cut the gap fillers to have exact size but that will create a minor gap which makes it look kind of cheap in my opinion.<br /><br />In summary, while the Stainless Steel Stove Gap Covers may seem like a convenient addition to your kitchen, there are some negative reasons why you may want to reconsider purchasing them.

Although well packaged and with no apparent damage to the box it arrived in, the blower housing was broken in two places.  Of course this was only discovered by the crew remodeling our kitchen on the day they were ready to install the cooker hood. The blower motor housing was made of plastic and attaches to the top of the housing with four screws.  That's the end of the bad news.<br /><br />The good news is that Futuro Futuro technical service was brilliant.  I sent photos of the damaged parts by email,  Within a couple of hours I got a profuse apology email reply with a tracking number of a replacement blower that was dispatched 2-day air to me.  The replacement blower came with a light alloy casting instead of plastic.  Fitting was a bit fiddly but straight forward.  Four screws and two electrical plugs.<br /><br />Things I like.  It is QUIET! Well on the low and middle settings it is.  It's a beautiful piece of engineering and the fit and finish are superb.  Clever magnetic catches keep the lovely brushed stainless steel panel in place below the filters.  These are easy to remove and pop in the dishwasher to clean.  The LED lights are nice and bright, but it would be nice to be able to choose the color temperature to match our other under counter lights.

AFPQVEZZAMACUFTO4RSIPHY5FZPA,B00ISB3Q9U,1.0,1403884323000,False,23,"We purchased this dishwasher 3 weeks ago to replace a 5-year old Whirlpool that had begun leaking.  First mistake: this &#34;KitchenAid&#34; dishwasher is made by Whirlpool.  I never would've purchased the &#34;premium&#34; brand KitchenAid if I'd known it was made by the same people that made the poor unit it was replacing.<br /><br />The main problem with this dishwasher: the interior design is just terrible.  Even though it's a standard size, the inside layout is so poor that we can't fit nearly the amount of dishes as any previous dishwasher we've had.  The upper rack is adjustable to two different heights.  If you set it on the upper setting, glasses won't fit in the upper rack because they bang into the silverware tray.  If you set it on the lower setting, normal size plates won't fit in the lower rack.  Which means you're basically hosed.  We've spent 3 weeks trying every combination we can think of to fit in a standard load of plates and glasses, and it's just impossible.<br /><br />You can remove the silverware trays on the silverware rack, but you may as well then just buy a much cheaper dishwasher that doesn't have that feature.  The store manager where we purchased it said to set one side of the upper rack high, and the other side low, so it would slide in &#34;diagonally&#34;, allowing us to fit plates and glasses normally.  But that won't work; the tabs that lock the rack into place won't engage if you try that.<br /><br />So you can just forget washing anything other than small cups and small plates in this dishwasher.<br /><br />Secondly, don't believe their hype about how &#34;quiet&#34; this dishwasher is.  When it's washing, it's about as quiet as any regular dishwasher we've ever had (at probably less than half the price).  But when the water is filling, which is frequently during the normal cycle, it's super loud.  Loud enough to be heard in any room in the house.<br /><br />As for cleaning ability, it's about average on plates and glasses.  We've tried silverware in both the upper tray, and in the removable holder on the lower rack, and silverware comes out less clean, and more spotty, in both locations compared to any other dishwasher we've ever had.<br /><br />The unit has a feature called &#34;ProDry&#34;, which I guess is supposed to be a premium feature to ensure items come out dry despite the new energy efficiency standards which came into effect several years ago.  But don't believe that one either: nothing that isn't loaded perfectly vertical, like a plate, comes out dry.  We need to manually dry off probably half of the contents of each load, even after it's run overnight.  Never had that problem in any previous dishwasher either.<br /><br />And the cycle time for normal wash is incredibly long.  Almost 3 hours total, and then a fan runs for another few hours (assumedly to dry the items inside, which doesn't work).  That fan is also loud enough to hear in the next room.<br /><br />Due to all these problems, we tried to return it just three days after it was installed, but the retailer wouldn't take it back.  They said I would have to get approval from KitchenAid for that.  So after over an hour on hold over the phone with KitchenAid, they told me I was out of luck, and they would not approve returning it, because it technically wasn't broken.<br /><br />The list price on this dishwasher is $1849.  Obviously making it priced as an extremely high end unit.  But as these problems make clear, this is an extremely poorly designed product.  I wouldn't recommend it an even 1/3 of that price.",very poor design,[],B00ISB3Q9U

I suspect that if your existing ice maker unit looks very similar to this, you're probably OK. Kenmore, Whirlpool, and who knows how many other brands all use the same core mechanism. Which makes sense - there's no point in reinventing the wheel for every fridge, and it makes it cheaper/easier for them to service.<br /><br />I have a 14-year-old (or so) Whirlpool model ED5THAXMS00 - its ice bin is in the door, not a drawer inside the freezer. So my machine's ice tray is parallel with the face of the door, it does not go front-to-back like many others. I don't know what went wrong with it; I think the ice ejector motor just locked up or burned out.<br /><br />So as you look at the photo of this, see how the white plastic lower edge, along the front, is at a 45-degree angle? Well, instead of a sloped front, like this, mine is flat. I realized that this model would not fit, as-is and I was about to box it back up. But, upon closer inspection, I realized I could swap out the front white plastic plate from my old one into the new assembly easily. It's the exact same basic mechanism, with the exact same dimensions. So I had to dismantle the motor housing (the black plastic part in the photo - it's 3 screws), and removed the sloped plate, and swapped in the flat front plate from the old one. Perfect fit. Took 5 extra minutes, if that.<br /><br />Also, my fridge has a light sensor across the door frame that tells the machine when to make ice or not. If the bin is full, the light sensor is blocked, and it won't make more ice. This ice unit comes with a wire lever that &#34;feels&#34; if the bin is full or not. This is for the internal drawer type of ice maker. If you have the door bin with the light sensor, you can just remove that wire lever, it comes right off.<br /><br />Seeing as my fridge was so old, my wife was looking at new refrigerators. And after doing this repair, I gotta say there's nothing more satisfying than a DIY repair in which you spend $40 instead of $1000 or more! Heck, a service call from an appliance shop probably would have run $300 surely. Very happy with this purchase, it was a surprisingly easy fix, even for an appliance novice like myself.",An easy fix - you can do it!,[],B00DNCJRX8

It worked, and was probably heat- and fireproof, but it had to be changed every once in a while and would leave gummy residue.<br /><br />So I decided to try this out. Installing took me literally minutes (like five), and it fit perfectly and securely in the groove between my stove and counters. I debated whether to cut it for length, and eventually did take about an inch or two off the top so it would seat flatly at the top end. It does lie flat on counter side and stove side.<br /><br />I have no reservations about this product. I, personally, wish the counter side was not quite as wide, but I will get used to that, and that does seem like the standard size for these types of products. (Some are even wider.) This also has an unusual smell to it (which I’m sure will go away) but a good smell. It smells like some of the trees out in my yard—like juniper or eucalyptus or something. I have no idea why that is; I brought it in from the mailbox and it was sealed in plastic. But, again, it’s a pleasant smell.<br /><br />And I like that these seem easy to lift out and wash, if needed, though I think a quick sponge wipe is all they’d need. And I believe you can put them in the dishwasher, too! Pardon the condition of my stove… it needs a good cleaning. (I cook a lot.)<br /><br />Good product for a very good price!","Simple concept, a snap to install, works great","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pxVNbmDAL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pxVNbmDAL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pxVNbmDAL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMSKSCnVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMSKSCnVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71cMSKSCnVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uAI1A0VsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uAI1A0VsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71uAI1A0VsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09TT744X9

Keys to happiness: (1) don't overfill, and DON'T pack in the coffee (2) make sure the little disc in the top is in place, it can fall out (this is the 'washer' that should be snapped into the lid, which is normally fine - it can and does come out sometimes) IF YOUR COFFEE IS SPRAYING OUT THE TOP, the disk has probably fallen out - it just snaps back in, OR you're packing in the coffee. (3) wipe any grounds off the surface where the lid closes onto the basket of the cups. (4) use a strong enough coffee to get your desired strength, Folgers dark roast is just enough for me, regular is too weak on large cup size. There is a bit of water comes out the top when brewing leaving some sitting on the cup once brewing is done and you open the filter basket - this seems to be normal.

After getting the Opal ice maker out, and on the counter, the manual says it should be sanitized before use. I loved how the ice scoop fits into the ice basket so I was clearly on the way to liking it. It has a nice sleek look to the display and also the overall unit. The unit notifies you when 100 hours of ice making has occurred by flashing the Clean button, and you need to perform a descaling. I loved the ease of draining the reservoir, the back of the unit has two clear tubes that easily detach for emptying into a pail or sink. The sanitization process for first time use took me about 30 minutes to complete all 3 three cycles. Then you fill up the unit with water and ice making starts! The unit is the quietest I have ever experienced, and the manual explains the noises you may hear. I loved the feature where when filling up the water for ice making -  when you have added enough water to fill it, the 'Add Water' light turns off. A small feature but such a nice touch. The unit also has an Defrosting light, in the event the auger becomes frozen and there is low ice production.

After about the fifth month, the water coming from the fridge tasted just like tap water; after a couple days with the new filter installed, my fridge's filtered water tasted more neutral/good again. Highly recommended!<br /><br />** Installation Instructions **<br /><br />Since it was difficult for me to find installation instructions online, and the instructions on the box worried me a little (you don't have to turn off the water to the fridge, really?), I went for broke and did the following (which worked great!):<br /><br />1. Open the fridge, and pop down the cover on the existing water filter (usually on top left 'ceiling' of the fridge) by pinching the sides in.<br /><br />2. Pull the filter downward (it's plugged into a swivel mount) from the front; there should be a little down arrow where you need to pull).<br /><br />3. Pull the filter straight out (should be a 45 degree downward angle at this point); expect a few drops of water to squirt out into the cover.<br /><br />4. Wipe the inside of the cover with a paper towel to dry it off.<br /><br />5. Push the new filter straight in (at 45 degree angle), then push it up so it's flat against the top of the fridge. Snap the cover back in place.<br /><br />Finally, its recommended you cycle water through the new filter for a few minutes before you start using fridge water for drinking. The first minute or so, water will be spitting out as if you had shut off the water to the house.

Even with a pan that was small enough at the bottom to fit on the grooves, it was sturdy enough to pan fry some fish, though the burner supports don't offer any decent grip so if you load heavier foods unevenly it can cause the pan to slide around, not good. Next up was just a small pot to fry some chicken, again it functions as one would expect. It's small enough to not need much oil unlike the larger fryer we have, so this is perfect for a smaller family or individual.<br />The ignition worked perfectly and burner levels adjust properly. The glass top looks nice but would probably prefer just aluminum as I'm worried the glass will eventually break.

This one is very quiet and after the spin cycle, the clothes are very dry so that drying time is cut in half. I have seen negative reviews complaining about the water level. I just turned it to super and didn't use the precise fill selection. Also, I saw a tip from another owner that if you select the fabric softener rinse, you will get more water in the rinse cycle. I used to have to close the laundry room door, which is right off the family room where we watch TV when using the old one. This one was so quiet I had to go check to see if it was running. I did find that I don't have to use as much detergent so that will save some money, there is a speed wash cycle if I need something in a hurry and shorter drying time. My best friend has a front loading HE washer and hates it. She saw this one and now wants to come try it out to see if she wants to sell hers and get one. Apparently mold and mildew buildup in hers is a problem. As far as how long this washer will last remains to be seen, but initially I am very pleased.<br /><br />Update 2/12/2013  I have been using the washer for a few weeks now and I still love it. I have read reviews where people have complained that it doesn't use enough water. If you learn to use the settings, you can get as much water as you want. I have to wash a lot of dirty jeans and towels. I use the super load setting and the fabric softener rinse setting. Both give plenty of water and my clothes get as clean as I could expect. No, not every stain comes out, but some of them are just permanent and no washing machine on earth could get them out.

AFRRMKEL6DB623BY4Z4OS2S3HZLQ,B074WCLFPV,4.0,1482197847000,True,12,Like many other people my item was received damaged. the spinner in the dishwasher was broken off so i can not review functionality. I have a replacement enroute so i will review that one when it arrives. The box it self was in perfect condition so i know the damage had to have happened at the manufacturer.  Also the dimensions are off. the dimensions are of the machine it self but the drain hose sticks out in the back and adds about 2 inches. If you receive a non damaged one then it looks like a good product.<br /><br />Now on to some of the comments other people made. Yes you have to rise you plate off so there are not chunks of food. the tubes for this are not huge. Nor is there a disposal attached.<br /><br />the soap packets.... some people say to just toss them at the bottom. The instructions actually say to put them in the little cup attachment that sits on the coffee cup ledge to ensure they are exposed to the water. So the people who put them in the covered powdered compartment there is a reason the packets don't always melt. This also may account for peoples complaints about the short wash not working. packets may not be exposed long enough to fully melt. I would advise a powdered or liquid detergent for those quick washes.<br /><br />Update 12/28/2016:<br /><br />I would like to update my review since I have since received a working dishwasher. I am now convinced my first one left the factory broken. My new one came with some drips of water in the tubes and a damp (but not moldy) smell inside the washer. My old one did not. This tells me they tested this one.<br />Pros:<br />This machine is no louder than my air purifiers. Actually I cannot hear it over the air purifiers. Except when it dispenses the water back into the sink.<br />Set up is nice and simple. Getting it out of the box takes more time and is more complicated. They pack it well.<br />I have done 3 loads. In 2 of the 3 loads my cascade pack melted appropriately. It was placed in the little carrier on the correct side. This may lead to using liquid only.<br />Works well<br /><br />Cons:<br />Till you get used to the sound of the dispensing water that quick jolt is kind of loud.<br /><br />Weird things:<br />For some reason normal wash takes more time then heavy wash even with an extra wash with heavy wash.,One Star & four star,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VeGht-sIL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VeGht-sIL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61VeGht-sIL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vxdr871mL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vxdr871mL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vxdr871mL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ax7yuumPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ax7yuumPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Ax7yuumPL.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lPOQvWr8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lPOQvWr8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71lPOQvWr8L.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B004MX8XO6

You need a medium phillips screwdriver, a pair of needle-nose pliers and maybe a small flat head screwdriver.  One person can do this.  It's mostly a matter of removing a dozen or so screws, replacing the heater in the housing it's in and reversing the process.  The hardest part is getting the heater housing back into place.  It's not too bad, but it didn't ""just slip in"".  The whole process took me an hour.

The metal brackets attached to the hinges rust too fast! In 6 years I got it completely corroded, so it started leaking at the door bottom. Both detachable metal brackets need to be replaced to stop the leak but you won't find this part.<br />3. Electronics periodically get into a glitch. The display indication periodically won't come up. The power cycling helps to reboot the internal microcontroller and get it working again.

I figured if they lasted even half as long, at least I would've broke even. Unfortunately for me, it didn't last at all. I flushed out a gallon or so of water after putting in the filter, just to be safe. I will say, the water pressure was amazing -- very fast (which is odd since others have commented that they had very little pressure).  But after filling up a glass, I noticed some tan-colored specs floating around. Figuring it just needed to be flushed more, I repeated another gallon.  Still debris.  This went on and on, but whatever it was, the water was not getting any cleaner.  After multiple gallons, I finally gave up, ordered the official (overpriced) GE filter, swapped out, and now I at least have clean water again.  Looking around at the reviews, it really seems like this product is a shot in the dark -- maybe you'll get one that works, maybe you'll get one that's actually new, maybe it'll leave stuff in your water, maybe it'll shoot out of your fridge.... it goes on and on.

At the time they arrived I had just replaced my Keurig filter, so I didn’t use them right away. Today I replaced it. I followed the soaking and rinsing instructions on the bag and which are the same as the OEM instructions. When I began soaking the filter I also pushed the filter under the water manually for a few seconds to insure the filter was completely soaked. I noted air bubbles escaping from the larger side of the filter, which is the bottom when installed.  One of the negative remarks I read mention a clogging of the filter. The trapped air bubbles were probably the culprit clogging the intake manifold. So I suggest pushing the filter under water to insure the filter is fully soaked and any air bubbles allowed to escape. I always use filtered water in my Keurig either from the refrigerator or our Brita. As I always do,  I ran 2 hot water cycles through our Keurig after installing a new filter. This operation cleans out any debris and allows me the check the water clarity. I read in another review about cloudy grayish colored water. The first hot water cycle produced a few bits of debris and the second was absolutely clear.<br />So in conclusion, the K&J filters perform just as well as the OEM Keurig filters at a fraction of the cost.

AEZVWBMV5KY4KR5G7WQJBYTNFYAQ,B01N75LD14,5.0,1451749144000,False,3,"I did a lot of research on range hoods before deciding to buy this one. The build quality is true to their YouTube videos, which poke fun at the quality of other similar looking range hoods, and prompted my extensive Google searching. I couldn't find a more powerful hood at the advertised sound level anywhere near this price point.<br /><br />Although it is not recommended by the manufacturer, I was able to install it by myself. The instructions make you put the mounting plate on the hood before you put it against the wall to make the marks for your drill holes, but I did that with just the mounting plate, which made a one man install very easy. Also, the manufacturer doesn't account for if you have tile behind the hood, so make sure you have some good toggle strap anchors for the body of the hood (pending you have no studs where the mounting plate screws will go), and some regular wall anchors for the top chimney bracket. The instructions to install are adequate, but could be better. They didn't make any mention of the bottom chimney bracket until it was time to put the chimney up, nor did they give good instructions on the order the parts at the bottom of the chimney need to go in. Through a bit of trial and error, I think the order from bottom up is: bottom chimney bracket, black square rubber gasket (which is mentioned nowhere), and then air diverter. The bottom chimney holes were not perfect as other reviewers have mentioned, and I too had the clamp that holds the power cord be in the way of the bottom chimney bracket fully seating itself. I think it would have been fine to just remove the clamp, but I shaved mine enough to allow the bracket to slide all the way on. I also opted for a rigid pipe between the air diverter and my connection to the exhaust pipe rather than their flexible pipe, but that was personal preference.<br /><br />Performance is great. What I find interesting is that it barely gets louder as you go through the speeds, but you can definitely tell that it is moving more air. The 300 CFM microwave range hood we had before was louder and did way less. My wife loves that she can cook the greasiest of things and her clothes don't smell like it afterwards. I spilled some flour in the bread machine cavity that started burning when the bread started baking about 15 ft away, and the fan cleared the room quickly. The lights are great, though I wish they matched the LED under cabinet lighting I installed, which has a warmer (yellower) look, or vise versa. The remote is gimmicky, but it works fine. I haven't tried the fan timer yet, but it sounds very useful. My only complaint is that there is no way to illuminate the panel to see the clock other than putting it in automatic mode, and my automatic mode seems to come on randomly sometimes. I may call the manufacturer about that.<br /><br />All in all, I am very satisfied with the hood and would recommend it to others.",Best bang for your buck range hood,[],B007W7EW0I

It's easy to grab a cone filter but after opening my first bag of basket filters well let's just say I didn't want to go through that every morning.

When it arrived and I saw what was being used for the sticky stuff I knew exactly what it was. Sure enough about two months later it became harder to get the filters out. The sticky stuff is Duct Seal which is non toxic and you can buy at any home improvement/hardware store for about $3. Just make sure it says non toxic on the packaging since I don't know if there is a brand out there that might be toxic. Pinch a small amount off and roll it around in the palm of your hand until soft and pliable then just press it on. Don't use to much, no more than twice the size of the piece you removed. I gave it 4 stars because I had to buy the duct seal, they should included some for replacement. With the renewed sticky part it works good as new.

First impression was that It's a lot lighter than I thought (lots of plastic). It's not as sturdy seeming as I initially thought it might be, either. But, at this price point, you can't ask for much more. It can hold more than I thought it might, as well. The way it works is, once again, different than I envisioned. You fill it up using the provided hose or other method, add the soap, and run. there is a hose attached to the bottom that is the draining hose—it works with gravity. You hang the hose off of a hook on the top side of the washer, and to drain you just unhook and flop it into a sink or tub. For rinsing you empty and refill with clean water, run again for a shorter time and then drain. The hose doesn't quite reach the top of the machine when it's hanging up, so if the washer is overfilled, water will spill out of the top of the hose.<br /><br />It's very simple, which is kind of a good thing for this product. Less moving parts=less to go wrong. The weak point will probably be the construction (guessing if it gets knocked hard enough, something will crack), the hose is quite thin and may be prone to cracking or ripping, and the motor (although it seems strong) may go at some point. Basically, be careful with it and don't overload it and you will probably be fine.<br /><br />Overall it's quite decent. I think it'll be a good alternative to making trips to the laundromat for smaller items. It's basically a step above washing by hand, though. You still have to wring the clothes out (no spin cycle), and manually drain, and refill for a rinse cycle, and so on. There's not much automation other than the motor which agitates the water. But, for a small washer I can stash under my kitchen table, I think I'll be using it quite often.",Not bad!,[],B005GM942C

When on the phone the customer service rep tried to sweet talk me into buying the sears yearly protection plan which is $60 per month so that's like $600 per year, plus an additional $100 for each service call,and its a contract so you cant cancel , if you cancel you have to pay for the entire repair.

Power to light and fan are the only two wires you will put together with the Black (power in house) then the rest is easy, ground takes copper wire, and the other two are on white.<br /><br />Now my old fan had two switches. So i unscrewed them both from wall.  (Turn breaker off unless good with wire). The bottom wire on both was black power, which they jumped when installing.  The white wire to fan, went to white wire controlling fan on new switch(im going off memory of the colors of switch). and the white wire went to the white on light.  I think the switch maybe a diffrent color, but maybe marked as 1 & 2.  Then as I stated i connected both power wires on switch together to the one black power wire.<br /><br />I then screwed in and put the 1 old switch back to fill hole.  It wont do anything, not connected. Put plate on and looks liks picture attached.<br /><br />When programming hold light button for 8 seconds until solid light.

Just don't overfill. The filter hangs over the edge but doesn't hinder snapping on the lid.  Toss the filter and you can reuse the rest.  Be sure to line up the hole made the first time so you don't punch more when you lower the handle. The k-cups that are designed for reuse leave sludge in your cup, but when I put a filter in it, works just like the expensive filled pods.  It even works in the My-K-cup.  The plastic filter that comes with it also leaves muck, but not when I put one of these paper filters inside the plastic.  Great coffee.  To reuse the cups above, just take off the lid, toss the filter, rinse pod and lid, and ready for another cup of coffee.  I have a drawer that holds 36 pods, fill it up once a week, and good to go. A box of 100 filters is less than $9.00. The original lids I bought have been reused at least 10 times and are still good. The filled K-cups are too expensive since I drink a lot of coffee and am basically ""thrifty"".

A well-known department store's parts store wanted the same price for one as this four-pack cost, so I called it a worthwhile bargain.<br /><br />I'd read a few other reviews about getting broken parts, and unfortunately I got a package that had obviously been opened and returned, and one of the end brackets of one shock was broken. one of those reviews had mentioned swapping a broken end out for an original end, so I did that in the interest of getting the repair done today, but it was a royal pain getting the end piece off.<br /><br />Otherwise, these new shocks seem fine and illustrate that the old ones were definitely shot, offering no thrust resistance at all. Installation wasn't nearly so easy as the video made it look, and I had to lightly file some plastic on both the last back shock and its mount on the washer tub, as the washer plastic was a little too thick to let the shock twist into place (but this problem had obviously affected the original parts too).<br /><br />I believe the washer will behave better; first test will be tomorrow. I'll update this review if these shocks seem to fail in short order or anything, but I hope we should be good for a few more years.  EDIT: The first day with the new shocks had a lot of new high-frequency/low-amplitude tub/washer vibration during the spin cycle, but I think that may be the shocks' break-in period, and I vaguely recall the washer behaving that way a long time ago.

AEP6VTYBNKHVVTJSAGTPIIPWL34A,B01N3UXB29,4.0,1503466337488,True,31,"I had a love hate relationship with this thing at first.  After 5 loads, the door lock mechanism stopped working.  Edgestar customer service was great.  When  I emailed them and asked for a replacement part  they wanted to replace the meachine; however, due to the difficulty I had getting this one into my second story place, I asked them to try the part first.  It was very easy to replace, took less than 5 minutes.  Now that we were up and running again, I ran into two issues  1- extremely long dry time, over three hours  2 - regular wash cyles left clothes will wet, even after two additional spin cycles.<br /><br />After reading up on HE washers, I figured out it was HE washer ignorance/ operator error.  I have never owned a high efficiency washer before.  I basically was using too much detergent,  which caused suds to hamper the pump functionality.  This caused the clothes to be somewhat wet when entering the dry cycle, which caused it to take hours to dry.  I put a shallow pan under the front, removed the coin catch plug, and poured water through the drain hose to flush out the pump and then I ran about 4 loads through rinse/ spin cycle.  I now use just two to three tsp detergent per wash and the dry time is reduced to 1-2 hours depending on the material of the clothing.<br /><br />As Douglas M mentioned,  the dry timer will hit 15 minutes then stay there.  According to customer service, there is a moisture sensor that stalls the timer till it is at the appropriate level, then it finishes the countdown.  I don't like this feature.  I have found that if I pause it earlier, once the door unlocks, the clothes are sometimes almost dry.  There are three preset drying times that can not be changed.  I wished there was a timed dry option that did not utilize the sensor.  If I pause it before the timer starts the final count down, it takes about 20 min to cool to where the safety will allow the door to unlock.  There is no override for this, which has caused me to be late for work when trying to get a load done in the morning.  (Gotta take everything out to avoid permanent press wrinkles)<br /><br />So, what I learned:<br />1- use very little detergent<br />2- washer/ dryer works best when 1/3 full if going to use dryer<br />3- don't leave clothes in machine after it stops unless you like serious wrinkles<br />4- although clothes feel damp when removed after dryer stops, they will be dry once they cool down<br /><br />Basically, this little machine is perfect for my needs.  I have a small home that will not accommodate a regular size washer/ dryer.  I do one load three or four days a week rather than one laundry day a week and it is working great.  The one star off was for lack of  the dryer timer options.<br /><br />James from Edgestar customer service was very patient with me on all my questions throughout my learning process and was always prompt with his responses.",Perfect for my needs... with learning curve,[],B01N3UXB29

The last one though, a Whirlpool lasted only 2 years and that was a troublesome 2 years.  I decided to replace it with the more expensive Broan with it's bigger motor.<br /><br />My main complaint after a week's use.  Instead of just kicking the toe piece and having the drawer pop out as other compactors build them you must open the cabinet door on the Broan, then bend over and pull out the drawer.  No handle on the drawer either!  What's with this?  Open a door, bend over, pull out the drawer, throw your napkin in the bin, push the drawer shut, then close the drawer!  I'm in my twilight years.  Bending over is not high on my list of want to do things.  What genius engineered that?  Couldn't they at least have spring loaded the drawer so that it would pop out a bit when the door was opened?<br /><br />Now the good part.  The compactor cycle is quiet and VERY powerful!  Sounds like a swiss watch with no squeaks and groans.  The extra PAC works well.  Don't buy a compactor without this feature.  The drawer does slide out easily and it just appears sturdier then the other compactors.  Also the drawer is not accordion pleated like most compactors.  That should make it much, much easier to clean.  The bags are much easier to put in it because you don't have that interference at the front where the drawer and the door are of one piece design.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Worth the extra expense but the two step process to throw away garbage is definitely two steps backwards!

By mid-April the food in the freezer portion was thawing and the refrigerator was not cooling properly. We called Frigidaire. We were directed to A&E Factory Service. It took 2 weeks for them to come out and another two weeks to come back to make the necessary repair (after obtaining the part). So, four weeks without a working refrigerator. Fast forward to October 13, 2021. The food in the freezer was completely thawed (some food had to be thrown away). To say we were annoyed is putting it mildly. My husband contacted Frigidaire. He was first hung up on by the first Customer Service rep. Then, after being put on hold for nearly an hour, was told we would have to have another service call. The customer service representative had a bad attitude and neglected to put in the service request. We had to go through the painful process all over again. This time the request was put in, but the wrong contact information was given. The repair person did came out and we were informed that the previous repair person had not cleared the refrigerant line and an air bubble was causing the problem. He cleared the air bubble and we were told it should now work fine. Here we are on December 29, 2021 and the freezer has again failed and the refrigerator is not cooling either. After three failures in less than a year, and due to all the inconveniences to include repairs not being correctly performed, terrible customer service experiences (to include failure(s) to request repairs and rude customer service representatives), all we wanted was a refund for what we paid ($579.73). Frigidaire does not stand behind their products and seems to have little regard for their customers. Consumers should not be asked to make due with products that do not work correctly/are defective with no real way of getting what they paid for: a reliable appliance that is also dependable and safe.<br /><br />We submitted a complaint to the Better Business Bureau and Frigidaire responded saying that the ""product may be covered for functional repairs under the terms of our limited one-year warranty.""<br /><br />Basically, we are out of luck and out $579.73 and stuck with a product that doesn't work. We can't even sell/donate it in good conscience because of it's inability to work correctly. I will never purchase another Fridgdaire/Electrolux product again.",Don't make our mistake; stay far away from Frigidaire,[],B073BZ3FDD

Something in the heating circuit was bad being that the heat was not working but the tumbler was. I didn't have an ohm meter on hand at the time to pin point what the main problem was so that's why this kit with everything in it is awesome. When I went back to replace these components I ohm tested everything and found the original high temp cutoff was blown. This made me wonder so I pulled off all the exhaust piping going out of the house and found multiple lint blockages causing excess build up of unexhausted heat. I cleared all the blockages and rerouted the poorly installed pipes so there are no sharp elbows where any lint that passes by the catcher can get hung up and clog again.

The control panel is not responding.  In doing a little research online, I am seeing that others have issues with the control panel.  Looks like the average cost is about $300 to repair.  Now, I bought this because it was touted as extremely energy efficient.

The customer service person then asked if I had purchased an extended warranty.  I did not.  I never purchase extended warranties.

AGE53OWN3AAFPNUORS25EGYYKBBQ,B005NK21MM,5.0,1391290668000,True,0,"well I in the process of ripping out the kitchen. it had a old large dishwasher that didn't work very well . ( I hate to do dishes ) anyway the dishes started piling up in the large wash sink next to washer dryer. so looking at alternatives and possibly something I could use in the rv after I came across this and read reviews.<br /><br />even though many positive reviews I still thought sure like what's that capable of 6 dishes oh wow and will it clean.<br /><br />when it arrived the box was damaged. it is packed very well and didn't see any damage on the dishwasher though water had gottin on it i guess the water left over from factory testing had spilt out some how when it was dropped. now what I did notice is the front is plastic and the edges of the plastic looked as if some one on the factory assembly line used a razor or something of that nature to trim the plastic and did not look very professional. in any case you don't see it unless inspecting . the build quality is so, so, with the plastic as for the rest, inside and out it looked like a normal dishwasher build just smaller. so even after it was opened and setup I still though how much can this little thing wash ( remember I have weeks of dirty dishes with crud all over them and the last time i washed that many dishes by hand it took over a hour )  after watching many video reviews of this dishwasher I didn't read the manual completely and just started loading it up. filled the soap dispenser and the rinse aid. (""cascade complete"", powder). since I had so many dishes I set it to 45 min wash. so I could do more loads in a faster time.<br /><br />when it was done I was amazed. I haven't seen dishes this clean in years and that's on 45min cycle. i though it would take days to get all the dishes clean but 5 washes latter and done. ( I had about 3 full normal dishwasher loads of dirty dishes) and i even did the pots and pans in it. oh did I mention its quiet at least 1/2 of the old large dishwasher .<br /><br />I really like the LCD display lets you know how much time is left and what cycle to choose. if you pack this dishwasher correctly you be surprised how many dirty dishes will fit and it gets them clean. now I read some reviews on it not cleaning well or spots on dishes. well i did pack it funky the second time and 3 dishes did not come out clean. one was a cup i had packed in the corner and one was a lid the bottom got clean but not the top of the lid did not and the other was a bowl that was also packed in a corner, it was half clean, like half was washed and other half still had the crusted on food. i learned fast to pack it right and everything came out clean from then on .<br /><br />one thing I noticed doing dishes with this washer is its fun. I have a bad back and hated bending over to load up the full size dishwasher even didn't do it many times from my back pain .<br /><br />I have this washer table top height and is a pleasure to load and also fast unloading<br /><br />so in the end this washer saves money easy to use, works great . small, fits where normal dishwashers cant. can be hidden in a closet if need be. and gets dishes clean. as long as it lasts its a win win even more so if i use it in rv<br /><br />just remember its small for a dishwasher, yet big enough like a large microwave oven, a large microwave oven . not small i have a small GE microwave that's half the size of this washer.<br /><br />to some it up "" I LOVE THIS DISHWASHER ""<br /><br />note , I have a $1,800.00 kitchen aid dishwasher for the new kitchen . now I just don't know if I going to use it or sell on craigslist. anybody contact me LOL: why?  well i trying to be energy efficient and save the planet and all that stuff. even trying solar and wind power.why use a big over kill dishwasher, sure it be great when family comes over but how often is that. 2 people this dishwasher is more then enough. the only reason I can see installing the expensive big dishwasher is just for resale if I sell the place that I don't plan on doing. sure it has every possible certification even can be used in a restaurant. hmmm just me and girlfriend. I not a catering service. its just for the 2 of us and possible company sometimes occasionally. I don't think so I can use the extra space that this dishwasher gives me and cost efficient save a couple of bucks in the process<br /><br />and to honest when using it I load it up but then I just cant help feeling the craze and don't run it k knowing I can load more dishes I actually make more dishes dirty on papas before running it . I love it . great if you have back pain use it at counter height and your world will change. dishes are no more of a problem. did I mention it works great and at this time it seems to be the most advanced in this type of dishwasher. you cant go wrong.

First of all, if the oven is turned off, there is no need to shut off power to the oven outlet.<br />2.  If you are careful, the removal and replacement can be done entirely from within the oven, without pulling it out to expose the back.<br />3.  When step #2 is being executed, there is a chance that one or both of the connecting wires will drop back behind the oven wall.<br />4.  If that happens, one can get a coat-hanger, bend it into a hook, and attempt to fish the wire back into the oven cavity.<br />5.  It turns out that even with the oven turned off, there is a hot terminal within reach of the said coat-hanger hook.<br />6.  When coat-hanger hook contacts hot terminal, step #1 becomes a moot point if you are lucky enough that the circuit breaker pops.<br />7.  If you are not so lucky, your family and/or friends will find you dead with your head stuck into the cavity of an ELECTRIC oven.<br /><br />Or you can bypass the above steps, cut power to the oven, pull it out from the wall, remove the back panel, and do it the right way.

Clothes were fresh smelling and I didn't have to use detergent. However, after several months we noticed clothes were no longer smelling as fresh. Contacted the company and no response. There are other choices out there for the exact same technology. I recommend finding a company that actually supports their products.","5 star product, but mine seems to have stopped working, trying to figure that out",[],B00AUWTYN2

While they were much bigger than I was picturing, they fit perfectly under the feet of my washing machine.<br /><br />Installing them was a bit tricky for me, but not due to the product at all, just due to my laundry room set up.<br /><br />Before they arrived I wanted to try lifting the washing machine up to see if I could do it on my own or if I needed additional help so I would be ready when they came. Didn’t take long to realize that I would most likely not be able to achieve success with just my 2 hands and a determined attitude (I have a bad lower back so I couldn’t lift with my knees and slide the pad into position at the same time), so I ended up buying a furniture lifter to help ease the process.<br /><br />The lifter was essentially a small dolly, with the straight edge sliding under the machine, the wheels acting as a fulcrum and the handle as a lever to lift the unit off the ground. Luckily, I only had to keep it lifted just long enough to slide the foot pads under it so I was able to do it by myself in a matter of a few minutes (not including the planning time and moving everything around to make enough space for me to use the lifter).<br /><br />I wish that I had taken video before and after installation to show the difference, but I didn’t even think of that until after the pads were under the unit so I apologize for not thinking of taking a video before but I don’t feel bad about not wanting to do it all over again just for a video lol. So, you’ll have to take my word for it and trust that it did indeed help quite a bit. As I previously stated, my laundry room is pretty small and tight, so the washer and dryer are right next to each other which makes the spin cycle pretty noisy at times. It also doesn’t help that the floor is smooth concrete so the washer would boogie around and knock into the dryer, or violently eject anything that was accidentally left on top of the washer before the cycle was finished. Once the pads were in place, the washer still boogies but this time it does so in its designated spot and items left on top may slide a little but for the most part stay put.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that is tired of hearing their washer moving an’ a shaking, but make sure to plan ahead so you don’t hurt yourself (or your floor for that matter) when moving your washer.",They really do work!,"[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IzP15SZoL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IzP15SZoL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IzP15SZoL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B0B5B5M91B

AH3D7N2XXU6RBBHHBEOR655RAIUQ,B00JV8GLAK,5.0,1459825501000,False,29,"A very good stove for the money, though it is not true convection, it is fan convection, which means the convection fan does not have an electric heating element. All gas convection stoves only have the fan going when the flames are off, true convection has the fan on more and the flames on less (after pre-heating) because of the electric supplemental heater. So true convection is a little better at browning meat and cooks a little more evenly (than fan convection), but most stoves with that cost about $500 more. Not worth it! (to me). Any convection is way better than any non-convection for even cooking and browning roasts. It works great.<br />This is free standing. Slide-ins are nice because you get a little more stove top area than a free standing. Again, about $500 more, not worth it! (to me).<br />The best stove I have ever had, a major upgrade for me. If you are a very serous cook and want it all, and money is not an option, get a slide-in (if you have counters on both sides) with true convection like NX58H9950WS, but be prepared to part with about $1000 more.<br />Does anyone know what the actual difference is between the bake and roast settings? I watched my cooking for bake and roast, both ran the lower burner with the fan going between firings. I could see no obvious difference, I thought the roast setting might turn on the top burner for some cycles but it never came on. I could find no real explanation of what the oven is supposed to do that is different.<br />The griddle is great. I thick slab of aluminum so it heats perfectly evenly when paired with the oval burner. For those that think the griddle is too thin, remember that aluminum has 3 times the thermal conductivity of cast iron. The griddle burner does not get it very hot because the oval burner has a moderate flame, making bacon took a bit longer that when I made it in a frying pan. However, the bacon comes out better because it is more evenly cooked. A great design, keeping the heat moderate will make the teflon last long time. Too much heat and metal spatulas are what kill teflon. I like the Teflon coating so it is easy to clean. Fits in the dishwasher.",Great stove for the money.,[],B00JV8GLAK

AH3CDTZ5RYO464FPJAOY47CIHXCQ,B08CY6WQBX,1.0,1678039287235,False,1,"LG designs great refrigerators. They're functional, efficient and attractive. Unfortunately, LG uses linear compressors. The LG Linear compressor has a poor life expectancy when compared to different types of reciprocating compressors like the piston or scroll typically found in AC units, or the digital inverter compressors used by Samsung and others. Piston compressors last 20 to 30 years, but the government wants them gone, so companies are stuck with lower life compressors.<br /><br />Linear compressors are cheaper and there are a few other advantages for refrigerators: however, none of that makes up for the failure rate of the design used by LG.<br /><br />The failure rate is so high, LG has settled two class action lawsuits in the last few years regarding the compressor, yet LG refuses to change the design, switch to a more reliable compressor type, or even admit the problem.<br /><br />All appliances produced now days have reliability issues. Part of the problem is US and European governments forcing companies to make more and more efficient appliances. The more efficient compressors and refrigeration equipment become, the less reliable they are. Add that to the poor quality control in Chinese and Korean factories, and the consumer is losing big.<br /><br />For example, AC units that have a very high seer rating (high energy efficiency) fail more often and cost more to repair than low seer units. Any savings on energy is over shadowed by repair costs over the life of the equipment. The government doesn't care how much we spend replacing and repairing appliances because they want to show everyone how much they're doing to help the environment. It's a bogus objective that comes at a very high cost to consumers. And there is more of it coming--water heaters (barely work now), washing machines and more refrigerator crap.<br /><br />Of course, LG has more reliable options so who knows what their internal costs are and the internal politics. You can bet that LG has looked closely at the economics of replacing the sealed cooling system with a more reliable one versus paying the claims, etc. They do what's in their best interest not yours.<br /><br />I've personally had two new $3000 LG fridges both fail within 5 years. I don't bother repairing them, I just buy new ones. In my experience, repairing sealed systems using linear compressors is usually a very short lived solution (as in likely to fail again within 2 yrs). But others may disagree.<br /><br />I won't buy any more LG refrigerators until they change the cooling system despite how much we like all the other LG features.<br /><br />As an aside: in my opinion Samsung closed systems are better than LG's, but they've got ice maker problems that they can't or won't fix. They've had to settle claims also. The Samsung design is not nearly as functional as the LG, but it may last longer.",Great Design Very Poor Mechanicals,[],B08CY6WQBX

The carbon block has millions of active sites on it's surface and within the structure which can absorb impurities like a sponge, and can absorb and hold other types of impurities on its surface like a magnet. Additionally this filter can catalytically breakdown other impurities very similar to the way a catalytic converter works in your automobile. These processes ensure that you are getting the cleanest and best tasting water possible. This filter should not be used with water that is micro biologically unsafe or of unknown quality, without adequate disinfection before and or after the filter. This filter has been tested by the manufacturer against ANSI/NSF Standard 42 for the reduction of Chlorine Tastes and Odors. MWF compatible filter removes the following contaminants: 99.30% of Lead at pH 6.5 99.90% of Lead at pH 8.5 94.50% of Mercury at pH 6.5 96.60% of Mercury at pH 8.5 99.92% of Asbestos 89.60% of Benzene 99.90% of P-Dichlorobenzene 99.99% of Cysts 98.70% of Carbofuran 97.00% of Chlorine 99.10% of Turbidity 97.60% of Particulates (Class I) All filters are certified to be free from leaks if properly installed and to function with the latest modifications from the OEM.

It only works when it is turned on, and it is normal after disconnection. When starting, the PTC thermistor is connected in series with the auxiliary coil, and the PTC thermistor enters high The effect can be achieved by cutting off the secondary coil in the resistance state.

B00CQEPC9W,Haussmann Wood Wall Panels Tree Life Through 18 in x 18 in S/3 Walnut,Amazon Home,3.0,1,,Haussmann,"[""Hand made from start to finish. 100% Sustainable eco friendly woods and finishes."", ""Made from sustainable Farmed teak wood. Only listed product included."", ""Carved from pieces of sustainable Monkey Pod (Acacia) wood.""]","[""Need unique one of a kind wall decor? Place several of same or different designs together to create a unique composition Hand-carved through from eco-friendly monkey pod wood, this arboreal triptych captures the sensual contours of trees from three unique perspectives. Trees dance gracefully with slender trunks, Branches billow high and wide as if saluting the sky. Rings show weathered cracks fan out through the crenellated cross-section of rings like bursting sun rays. Viewed together these woodsy panels joyfully remind us that nature is the ultimate artist. Set of 3 individual panels shows the body of the tree, tree trunks, the covering, branches, and life cycle, slice with rings to count. Pattern layout is marked by hand and then the drill and finger saw method is used to rough out the design. Then each panel is hand chiseled for a 3D look. Each panel has two hangers on the back so they can be arranged horizontally, vertically, or in a triangular fashion Hand rubbed in natural nontoxic Walnut tone oil that is polished to a matte finish. Color ranges from medium to dark Walnut brown tones that will darken as the wood ages *Please Note* There will be various separations or cracks and color will vary from the pictures depicted for every single piece. No two pieces will match *YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE THE PIECE PICTURED. AS THAT IS JUST A REPRESENTATION OF THE DESIGN AND FINISH TONE. There will be visible marks from carving, patches from repairs, knot holes, natural inclusions, and worm holes. There will be various separations or cracks on your piece when it arrives. They naturally occurred as the wood was dried. Over time, continued shrinkage will accentuate existing separations or generate new ones. This does not compromise the structural performance or integrity of the wood and is considered inherent to the natural beauty of the design. Hand made from start to finish. 100% Sustainable eco friendly woods and finishes Carved from pieces of sustainable Monkey Pod (Acacia) wood.

We are the green alternative to the conventional filter. Our activated carbon is produced using a new technology that carbonizes dried coconut shells in an enclosed self-sustaining system. This process captures and converts the emissions into useful thermal energy. We offer a variety of filters that are compatible with all leading brand refrigerators. Coconuts are a renewable and sustainable source of charcoal. Grown in over 80 countries, coconuts have a total production of 61 million tons per year. All those husks are being tossed or burned as waste! We take those husks and use them to create the charcoal for our carbon filters. Coconut carbon is superior to other sources of activated carbon. It has 50% more micro-pores for capturing contaminants. For more information please visit the Swift Green Website.
